__label1__,"Chef Works CSBA-BCS Chalk Stripe Bib Apron with Pockets, 34-1/4-Inch Length by 27-Inch Width, Black/White",Simple but high quality,I really like this apron it has a very simple design. I love cooking and this one is my best friend. With this I could do my chores without getting dirty.
__label1__,"Abdtech 130"" Mini LED Projector 800 Lumens Multimedia Beamer Portable Home Theatre Projectors",Sparkling picture with mini projector!!,"That's projector I look for, which is extremely suitable to office activities. This projector is easy to use, small and can be put to any places I want. With this one, I feel very confident when present a new ideal without getting technical problems. The picture is much better than others, crystal and doesn't make color errors. Great product and reasonable price!!<br />I will buy it again on demand and also highly recommend to others."
__label2__,Scalp Massager by Body Back Company,Head-gasm!!,"Okay, I bought this for a friend thinking it would be a novelty gift.  I tried it, loved it, and bought another one for me!  I probably look a little funny using it, but it feels fantastic.  I have my head massager on top of my nightstand.  A couple of swipes of this on my head and I'm ready for bed.  This is not to be used in front of others, as your friends will see your groan and roll your eyes as you use this.  Yes, it feels that good."
__label1__,"1"" Inch Round Metallic Blue Color Code Dot Stickers - 1,000 Circle Labels Per Roll",Not as shown,The color is not exact to the picture shown which is extremely disappointing. How can you sell something when it is way off from the description. Completely throws off what i was going to use them for.
__label1__,"Marcato Atlas Wellness 150 Pasta Maker, Stainless Steel",Easier than I thought it would be,"When I decided I wanted to start making my own pasta, this was the pastamaker recommended to me. The process takes a long time, but it was much easier than I expected, and the final result is worth it. I don't think I'll ever go back to buying it in a box!"
__label1__,Red Water Tracing & Leak Detection Flourescent Dye - 1 Gallon,Good Price and Better quality,"I used the red dye from this company to locate a leak in my septic tank, we were able to see the water in the tank had turned bright red so we were satisfied with the end result. Good price as well"
__label2__,Fumoto F-103 Engine Oil Drain Valve,installed on Highlander 2010,"first-time oil changer here, so decided to make job easier in the future and installed F-103S (one with small nipple)<br /><br />Observations:<br /><br />1) Don't get F-103S, get regular F-103 - more then enough.<br /><br />2) it sticks out by ~1/4"" - 3/8"" from protected bottom level. Safe in day-to-day driving, but I would think twice about jumping sidewalks or driving over rocks.<br /><br />3) this is quality piece, NOT some junk.<br /><br />4) don't worry about valve opening by itself due to driving - highly unlikely.<br /><br />5)it is made from soft bronze, so go light on torque<br /><br />6) last, but main reason for taking down 2 stars: final position, after tightening to specs, is NO GOOD: it leaves ball part of the piece in lowest point, so it sticks out, and I could not find a way to move it to the highest point without either over tightening or under tightening. Washers of different thickness would probably let you adjust final position, but i didn't have that option.<br /><br />Overall, come prepared, buy couple of washers and you will be fine."
__label2__,The Well of Tears (The Dream Stewards),Shoots for epic. Doesn't quite make it,"This is a fairly entertaining retread of familiar territory, and I did find parts to be extremely moving (especially when dealing with loss).<br /><br />However, the book failed to impress me for a number of reasons:<br />1/ A slew of cliched situations and plot devices (ancient prophecy, circle of power, unnamed evil afoot, etc. )<br />2/ The characters were entirely one dimensional, and it was apparent at first encounter who was good and who was evil. No shades of grey.<br />3/ Each character's motivation was similarly obvious. Greed/power for the evil, and duty/honor for the good.<br />4/ The major plot line was extremely weak, was resolved with minimal fuss, and ended with a just-as-weak cliffhanger.<br /><br />This is not epic GRRM, and neither is it even close to the more mass market efforts by Goodkind. What it is, is a lazy read with minimal fuss and excitement, that won't raise your pulse rate as you read it.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars for writing style, 2 stars for content, and rounded up.<br /><br />Happy Reading!"
__label2__,Bloch Girl's Endura Stirrup Comfort Tights M/L Tan,Fit as expected,"The tights fit as expected, but did have several small pulls after only a few wears.  They have not run yet though."
__label1__,Mario Kart 8 - Nintendo Wii U,Guilty pleasure,"I know that this is a kid game, but come on! It's awesome! I play it mainly to distress after a hard day at work, and I have to say that it works BECAUSE it's a kid game. I just forget my troubles until I dive in the next day for another few hours in the adult world."
__label1__,"Quaker Breakfast Cookies, Oatmeal Chocolate Chip, 6 Cookies Per Box (Pack of 6)",taste old and are not edible.,The cookies taste old and are not edible. They are not past the expiration date yet even the chips are white like how old chocolate turns white. These are terrible! They give you plenty for a snack and truly great taste.
__label2__,Polar FT60 Men's Heart Rate Monitor Watch (Black with White Display),While I really like this monitor because it's simple to program and keeps ...,"My old Timex gave out.  While I really like this monitor because it's simple to program and keeps a comprehensive long term performance record of your workouts , I wish it had a heart rate recovery feature like my old Timex. From what I've read, the rate of recovery is a very good indicator of your fitness level.  I'm surprised it's not included as a feature in what is otherwise an excellent fitness monitor."
__label1__,Channel Master DVR+ Bundle - subscription free digital video recorder with web features and channel guide (CM7500BDL2),Read this before you purchase an antenna DVR,"I am giving this DVR 5 stars simply because it does what it is supposed to do reliably.  I have tried almost every DVR that claims to do the same thing.  Let me tell you, the only other one on the market that comes close is the TiVo.  In fact, the TiVo is a better choice If you are looking for more features/bells and whistles and don't mind paying the monthly fee.  I also own a TiVo and to be honest, I like it better primarily because it has Netflix, but I think the DVR+ is a better overall performing unit and would choose it over TiVo and that's why I bought this one because I'm not interest in paying 14 bucks a month to have access to Netflix.  My Roku box does that just fine.<br /><br />I have owned it for several months now and day in and day out it does what it is supposed to do just like I was used to with my old satellite DVR.  The features are on par with most cable or satellite DVR experiences.  If you have ever used one of those this works just the same except for one feature.  This unit lacks the ability to omit repeats in series recordings.  I was told by Channel Master that this was designed this way because if you are not connected to the internet then the box does not receive the information from the broadcaster if it is new or a repeat.  They told me they had a lot of requests for this and looking into adding this capability for those users who are connected to the internet.  The only other thing I would complain about is the remote control.  It is not comfortable In the hand as most cable/satellite remotes because it is thin and the DVR playback buttons are on the bottom of the remote making it a two hand process to jump commercials.  This is not a deal breaker though, you get use to it.  And if you can't get use to it, a universal remote is always an option.<br /><br />If you own an antenna and want a DVR that works like the one you use to have with cable or satellite, the DVR+ is the best bang for the buck.  The other units on the market just don't stack up the same.  Some do not include a remote and require a tablet to control (cumbersome!), others only have a single tuner so you can only record one show at a time, none have an on-screen guide as robust as the DVR+ without paying a fee and last but not least they are not near as simple to use, at least the several different units I have tried.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that I have already had two software updates in the few months that I have owned it. (Yay!  They are making it better).  Plus I have been told that the have a whole slew of internet content coming later this year.(Will see if that pans out)<br /><br />If you want a reliable antenna DVR without monthly fee's, this is the one to buy.  Don't waste your money on others like I did, spend a little extra dough and buy this one.  In the Antenna DVR department, you truly do get what you pay for."
__label2__,"Tupperware 12"" Round Pie Keeper Sheer with Red Seal","Perfect for pies, works in a pinch for cookies and cupcakes",Tupperware is a great brand.  I have wanted this item for a while.  Have been discouraged by the company's choice of colors but red is great!
__label1__,"Gecko Bluetooth Multi-function Smart Tag for iPhone iPad iOS only, GT101",Excellent!!!,"This little thingy is like a remote control for my phone, I can use it to take a selfy of myself and girlfriend or play music from my phone. Need to be in BT range but it works fine."

Approach with an open mind and plenty of patience!<br /><br />wrapped around the box, doesn't WORRY ABOUT a loss of stars but just a word of warning to others to be gentle with this kind of kit. I generally am but maybe the excitement got to me!!="
__label2__,UltraTech UT1270 12V 7 Ah Sealed Lead Acid Alarm Battery UT-1270,50% less than local supply,"For a household alarm system, this battery is a necessity and the alarm company charges twice as much for the unit, PLUS a $75 service call.  This is exactly the same down to the make, size, and specs. And install is just pull two small electrical wires and re-attach to the new unit and you’re done."
__label2__,Photive BTH3 Over-The-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Built-in Mic and 12 Hour Battery. Includes Hard Travel Case.,Great purchase!,"So, I got these to take on vacation, so I could listen to my music without disturbing others and I love them. When turned on, they have a blue light that blinks every few seconds, but I asked and that did not bother those around me, and I can't see it unless I'm in front of a mirror or in a dark room. I'm no audiophile, but the bass sounds solid to me and the mids and highs are crisp enough for me. I have not had to charge them since the initial charge, and that was two weeks ago. I listen for 1-3 hours a day. The controls are not as intuitive as I'd like, simply because they are exactly the same on each side, so if I forget which side the volume is on I can accidentally skip forward or back a track by using the those controls on the other side. They are very comfortable, and I wear glasses, even, but after about 3 hours I'm ready to take them off. I've taken calls on them and the person on the other end says it sounds fine, but it sounds a little funny to me because my voice is muffled and I'm always afraid I'm talking really loudly. I'm really happy with them."
__label2__,"Totes Basic Automatic Umbrella,Black,One Size",Sleek Design that Works,"I bought one of these for each car. Vey sleek design and quality product, sturdy umbrella. Would fit in a purse or backpack too"
__label2__,Rugged Ridge 11206.01 Black Cowl Vent Cover,way better than that plastic thing that came stock on the ...,way better than that plastic thing that came stock on the jeep and its paintable to match or leave it as is. one of the best buys I have done yet.
__label2__,Timex Men's T21942 Elevated Classics Dress Gold-Tone Expansion Band Watch,My gold warch,An amazing and good looking watch.

__label2__,Kuldip Unisex Pashmina Scarf Shawl Wrap Throw Dark Peacock,Christmas gift,"I love the fabric, color, and quality! My BFF loves it and it was perfect gift for her. I wish I could have ordered more."
__label1__,Ride With The Wind,Great action drama,Craig Nelson (The Coach) is terrific in this movie. He is an aging AMA driver that helps out a young man.  There is plenty of romance going on (Helen Shaver) and the AMA flat track scenes are fantastic.  A really good movie that is based on a real story.  My husband and I enjoyed it a lot.
__label2__,Sennheiser CX 890i Headset (Black),Good sound quality,The sound quality is  good the mids are nice detailed and the high are a little to high.  But other than that the headphones are good.
__label2__,Omron 3 Series Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor (Model BP629) Clinically Proven Accurate,Good Product,Worked right out of box. Pump seemed to be new but could not tell as box was not have factory seal. I would liked to have item better packaged for shipping. But the main thing is it works :)

When they arrived I was excited at how nice these packing cubes actually were.<br /><br />The zippers are strong, the color is vibrant and the material is lightweight but strong and the stitching is durable. I love that they have handles and that they are double stitched for easy no worry carrying.<br /><br />I like the mesh on the front so you can see what is packed. The Shoe bag is a great size, I fit 6 pairs of adult shoes and could have fit in 1 or 2 more. I also found the shoe bag can double as a laundry bag when traveling.<br /><br />The varying sizes make for great organization and a number of different uses. I found that the two bigger sizes were great to use for clothing. After my flight, my clothes were less wrinkled than usual because they didn't slide all over the suitcase. The smaller sizes were great for keeping my family's medications neat and handy in my carry on and for personal care items and electronic accessories and cords.<br /><br />I am very happy with these packing cubes and wonder how I ever packed before without them. It's a great way to pack your things neatly and be able to find them quickly. A definite must have for travelers, whether you travel frequently or only every so often!"

__label2__,Swivel Night Light Bases (Set of 3),not the right shape,"While this product will work fine for those that want this shape, I needed something with a bottom that has a slight  ’S’ shape in order to fit in a ceramic base. I’m sure that this will be fine for those only wanting a bare night light, or one that will accommodate some form of slide on shield, but not for what I wanted..."

__label1__,Journee Collection Womens Regular Sized and Wide-Calf Mid-Calf Slouch Riding Boots Camel 8,Super soft on the inside,"They are super soft on the inside, and I get tons of compliments on them. They truly have terrible arch support though, so I wouldn't recommend wearing them all day. They look great paired with an oversize sweater and skinny jeans or leggings."
__label2__,Sangean CL-100 Table-Top Weather Hazard Alert with AM/FM-RBDS Alarm Clock Radio,Remarkably Good Sangean CL-100 Weather Radio,"&#34;SAME&#34; county code entry helps to limit alerts to only those events and localities that could actually pose a hazard, and it actually works very well!  If you've been dissatisfied with the poor performance or unwanted alerts from older, poorer-quality weather radios, you will find this Sangean CL-100 a welcome improvement.  The FM reception is excellent, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small radio; not &#34;room-filling&#34; but still very listenable for music, and clear for voice.  AM reception llacks sensitivity and has noticeable 60 hz hum on much of the band, but in many areas, there is little to listen to on AM.  It's hard to imagine a compact AM/FM/Weather Radio that would be any better."
__label2__,"Munchkin Backseat Organizer, Black",Works well and allows me to stay organized.,"I would suggest putting this on the opposite side of where your child sits.  My son is now 16-months and is always trying to grab items from the organizer.  I recommend this product to any mom on the go.  I store extra items here so if I forget to put it in my diaper bag---wipes, sanitizer, small toys and cups are at my disposal."

__label2__,"Pet Portable Crate – Great For Travel, Home And Outdoor – For Dog’s, Cat’s And Puppies – Comes With A Carrying Case – Folds Easy And Space Free",Dog Escaped in Less Than An Hour,"We bought the large size for our very docile and well behaved standard poodle and gave it a test run while we went to church.  We came home an hour later and found her out, and when we investigated the crate we realized she must have put pressure on the zipper and unzipped it.  We took a luggage lock and locked the two zippers together, and went out for another short trip.  We came home and found her out again, only this time she pushed hard enough against the door to rip the zipper out at the seam.<br /><br />We returned the damaged crate (Amazon refunded us) and went with a sturdier plastic crate with metal bar door.  I loved the looks of this and I'm sad it didn't work!  I think any dog, no matter what size, is going to look at this crate as a challenge and work to get out of it."

__label2__,"Elixir Golf Sun Protection Arm Cooling Sleeve-1 Pair, White",Low cost.  Works fairly well.,"Low cost.  Very stretchy.  They block sun well enough for all-day riding.  As a reminder, these are not magic.  The cooling effect is:<br />A) Reflection of sunlight.  If you're not wearing white ones, they will absorb sunlight and get hot.<br />B) Evaporative cooling.  If you are not sweating, and there is no airflow, then you will feel warm.<br /><br />I'm 197cm (6'5&#34;) tall.  My biceps are 13.5&#34; and my forearms are 12&#34; in circumference.  From armpit to wrist on the inside is 25&#34;.  I find that these sleeves end up settling to about 16.5 inches long on my arms.  That leaves about 1/2 inch between my longest cycling jersey and these; plus there is a gap of 2-3 inches from my glove line to these.  I can stretch to cover more, but that's what they retract to over time.<br /><br />They are like thin, stretchy socks, so if you have an agitator post in your washer, these could get hung up.  I usually just put a little dish soap on them and do a quick scrub in the kitchen sink every 2-3 rides, and make sure they are laid out to dry in the heat after a ride.  That being said, I've had no problems running them through the laundry."

__label2__,Golf Gifts & Gallery Clubhouse Collection Electric Putting Cup,Saves time and functions well,"I have a 7 year old daughter that is a competetive junior golfer.  She practices putting everyday at home and goes to the course 2x a week.  I have a large indoor putting green and just walking to the other end to gather balls is just too slow and tends to lengthen her training time.  So we decided to try this.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1.  Portable - This is very small and can be moved around as long as you have an outlet.<br />2.  Ball return - You can adjust the ball return speed.  So if you are practicing short putts adjust the speed slower so that the ball does not come back at you too fast.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.  Moves - This does not have the weight and does not stay in place very well.  After a few putts, you will have to reposition it again since it moves.  I placed a 1 pound dumbbell on top of it so that it does not move.  It worked.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Aside from having to use weights to keep it in place, it has actually been a very useful tool.  She can hit more putts during her 1 hour practice session which will help her be a better golfer."
__label1__,Matricom G-Box Q² Android TV Streaming Media Mini PC [2GB/16GB/4K] Quad/Octo Core,My favorite streamer,"I own Roku 3 and Apple TV, Nexus player from Google and the Amazon fire box. For what Im looking for the Q is the only box that does the job the right way without hassles. I have had nothing but problems with the apple Tv from having the jailbreak this thing every month I just gave up on that. XBMC runs flawlessly on the Q and I havent had to do a thing to it. Just run and it works and I mean everything works. All the content I add to XBMC on here plays perfectly. Even the apple TV jailbroken wouldn't play some of my collection.

I really didn't want to pay $300-$500 for a longer lens and I'm glad I didn't have to.<br /><br />This has to be the best bang for the buck lens out there. It takes really sharp images, especially macro.<br /><br />I've read some complaints that you need a tripod to shoot macro otherwise you can't get it focus or get a blurry photo. However, my experience has been different. I've had absolutely no trouble shooting at 300mm in macro holding it with just my hands. I was absolutely shocked at how detailed and clean the image was, especially since it doesn't have image stabilization.<br /><br />My dad was visiting and he was blown away with the image quality of the lens. He was even taking some photos with it and said he was impressed with how fast it took photos. I trust his opinion a lot because he's been doing photography for almost 40 years, if not longer.<br /><br />If you want a very nice macro lens you really cant go wrong with the Sigma. I would give it more stars if I could because that's how good it is.<br /><br />Update 4-27-14<br /><br />So far I'm still enjoying the lens but I'm starting to notice the auto-focus isn't very good. It zooms in and out multiple times and still wont focus. Sometimes it does focus, other times it takes multiple tries before it works. I've got into the habit of just manually focusing since it's faster and the pictures seem to be more clear than using AF. I'm not deducting a star because I still believe the lens is great for the price and still takes really nice images. The AF problem is more of an annoyance than anything for me."

So, how did he become the most wanted man in Christendom? Not even Hugh knows. The mission to capture him and retrieve whatever it is he's supposed to have is a mystery to him.<br /><br />This is an excellent story with twists and turns a plenty.

But they are not even jumbo at all. They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos. So several look like they have had an operation, and split entirely apart and melted back together. But, what do you expect from anything now days that has 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. Overall, I'll rate these 3 stars, and lucky they get that. Would not recommend to toddlers, but only kids 5 and up, and expect them to cry when they get 4 exact duplicate dinosaurs."

__label2__,Corsair Obsidian Series Black 550D Mid Tower Computer Case,Good Case!,"I replaced a Corsair 500R with this case and I'm glad I did. I originally replaced the 500R because it just felt cheaply made and it wasn't that great to build in. The 550D has a very solid build quality and I haven't had a single issue with it since I bought it around 6 months or so ago.<br /><br />I love the magnetic dust filters on the side and top of the case and they do a very good job catching most of the dust and keeping the inside of your case relatively dust free. The bottom dust filter is good but mine has started to bend a little causing it to be slightly warped at the back of the case. Although the dust filters work great they are stating to get hard to clean. No matter if I spray them with air or wash them in the sink they still look dusty all the time. It doesn't effect them working but it does make your computer look dirty all the time.<br /><br />The cable management is pretty good on this case but I would have like more places to tie cables down on the top behind the motherboard tray. I also would've liked if the motherboard tray was raised slightly more in order to run cables behind the motherboard better. I was only able to run 4 cables behind the motherboard before there just wasn't anymore space and I couldn't screw the motherboard down. I would fully recommend getting a fully modular power supply to make building in the 550D easier. You may have issues getting the back door to fully close with all the extra connectors you're not using.<br /><br />I know all Corsair cases are made for the H100 cooler but I had a hell of a time installing the H100 in this case. The problem I had was there was barely enough space at the top between the motherboard and the radiator to clear my motherboard power connector. So right now the fans on the H100 are sitting right on top of my power connector pushing it down slightly. Other people may not have the same issue depending on where the connector sits on their motherboard. If you have one on the top of your motherboard be warned that it will be a tight fit.<br /><br />Lastly the main reason why people will buy this case, the sound dampening foam. In my experience, it doesn't do much of anything to quiet your computer down. I've tried with the side and top panels off and on and I noticed no difference in sound but obviously a lot higher temperatures with the panels on. The main reason I think it doesn't work is the foam is way too thin in order to stop enough sound to notice a difference. I feel as though they should just remove the foam all together from the 550D and sell it for a little cheaper.<br /><br />Overall the 550D is a very nice case once you look past the few annoyances it has. I've owned several cases before buying this one and so far this has been the best case I owned. I think for its price point Corsair makes some of the best looking and best made cases around. There's little doubt in my mind I'd ever consider buying another brand of case in the future unless other companies really step their game up as far as build quality."

I hate it when the person next to me has their light on and I'm trying to sleep! So I saw the great reviews for this eye mask and thought I'd try it out. I went to Rome last month and used it for the flight over and had a really good rest. It could also be that I tried out this new product I found [[ASIN:B00JRMNVRG JetFighter Sleep - Jet Lag Relief - Fights Jet Lag Symptoms Like Sleeplessness and Disturbed Sleep - 30 Sleep Aid Pills - Non Homeopathic - Contains Melatonin - Made in the USA]] which knocked me right out. Anyway, they work really well together. The mask drowned out all of the light and was comfortable enough to wear for the entire 9 hour flight. The material is really comfortable and the band in the back wasn't too restrictive. Overall I am very pleased with my eye mask and would definitely recommend it to others."

I find the quality of the bands to be really good. The bands have bright colors, and you get a  lot of colors in the deluxe kit.  The bands are soft, odorless, the have a good stretch which makes it easier for me to do complex designs.  The hooks are alright.  I do prefer s-clips over c-clips.  The loom itself is really good.  It's sturdy and not flimsy.  You can extend the looms to any length just keep attaching more looms.<br /><br />As far as i'm concerned with the many brands I've tried for looms, Inifity loom bands are on top.

__label2__,Samsung UN32EH4003 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LED TV (2012 Model),Great Bedroom TV,"This TV was a replacement for a 5-year-old, 26-inch ""flat screen"" LG TV for use in a bedroom.<br /><br />For starters, the TV's bezel is extremely narrow and the TV is MUCH thinner than our old TV.  Additionally, I was surprised how much lighter (at least 15 pounds) this TV is than the older LG.<br /><br />On to the important information... This TV's picture is beautiful!  I cannot over state this.  Samsung LED TV's are simply gorgeous, and this ""lower-end"" model is no different.  It's much better than the older TV and is similar to, or better than, our primary 55"" Samsung LED TV.  Colors are vibrant, whites are bright, and blacks are dark.  Setup out of the box took around 30 minutes--this included screwing the base to the TV and completing the simple, guided on-screen setup.<br /><br />The contested point, and what I was worried about:  the sound.  In my opinion (and more importantly the wife's!), the sound is perfectly fine for a bedroom TV.  And I'm sure it would be OK for a primary TV setup (although a soundbar would be MUCH better).  My only complaint about the sound is that there is little graduation between the low and high volume.  What do I mean?  To me the TV is quiet, and then it is LOUD!  There is little ""in between"" volume.  Other than that complaint, the sound is fine.<br /><br />Overall, this TV is a great buy.  It has an awesome picture, and is a perfect TV."

They are free of corn, wheat, artificial flavors or preservatives.<br /><br />There were no guidelines for feeding other than to break into pieces for a small dog. I wasn't crazy to see that they contained both sugar (sucrose) and salt. Plus this company does not provide easily accessible information about where the ingredients are sourced. You will not find it on the website or the package. You must call Customer Service. They keep a list of the origins of the proteins but not all the ingredients.

__label2__,"basyx by HON VL103 Mid-Back Leather Executive Task Chair for Office or Computer Desk, Black","Sleek look, upright chair for back support, but this is not an ergonomic chair..","In my old job, we would have to undergo ergonomic training and testing and we were given the best ergonomic seats of the time.  And since then, I have been trying out different chairs that are stylish, not too expensive but most of all, provides comfort and good back support.  If I can find an ergonomic office chair for a low price, I would be happy but most of the time, anything within the $50-$200 range are typically straightforward chairs.<br /><br />This leads me to the latest office chair that I am using in the office...the basyx VL103 by Hon.<br /><br />I.  INSTALLATION<br /><br />Installation was easy.  Actually, I came home and my wife already had put it together and she said it took her less than half an hour.  I did notice that when it came in, the chair came with the original toolset but also came with a newer revised tool-set that was affixed to the top of the box. So, there must have been a revision to this chair.<br /><br />II.  STYLE<br /><br />I love the look of the basyx VL103.  Leather seat (not thick leather), chrome stands and also under the arm rest area and because of the way it looks and it's not all plastic, is probably why it's close to $150 (on Amazon).  It's very sleek and of the several office chairs that I have owned, this is the best looking one that I have had so far.<br /><br />III.  COMFORT & EASE OF USE<br /><br />Upon putting it together, you have one lever that adjusts the up and down movement and there is a tilt tension, so you can pull the lever out and tilt it to become upright and lock or for those who want to adjust the tilt of the chair.  But this is not an ergonomic seat, so you can't adjust the back, nor can you adjust the seat to move it up or curved.  But there is good enough padding on the seat area and really good support for the mid-back.<br /><br />This is important to know because typically, for an office chair around $100 or so, the back seat is not upright and they are not as durable.  This one makes you sit in agood posture and that's what I enjoy about it so far.  Granted, I still want an ergonomic chair that I can always adjust (especially long hours of working) but many of them are expensive.  For this seat at under $150, it's great in mid-back support and having you sit in a straight position.<br /><br />And the caster wheels work good.  I use a mat around my desk area and am able to move freely.<br /><br />IV.  JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />One of the difficult things about purchasing an office chair online is that you want to sit on one before buying.  It's important as all chairs are subjective to the one using it.  But I can say that this is not a cheap chair with mesh backing, nor is it a chair with a flimsy back support.  For it's price and it's style, it's definitely worth it at the under $150 price point.<br /><br />With that being said... For those who suffer from back problems, you probably want to look for an ergonomic seat but you're going to have to pay a little more for it (see [[ASIN:B004LQ1URQ Office Star WorkSmart Professional Dual Function Ergonomic High Back Eco Leather Chair, Black]] or if you want the best and are willing to pay over $500 (see [[ASIN:B003Y5BF7A ErgoHuman Executive Chair with Headrest in Black]]).  Also, note that there are ergonomic chairs sold on Amazon that are cheaper than this chair, but they tend to break easy (the lever or pivots, so beware of cheap ergonomic office chairs).<br /><br />But if you need one that will force you to sit in a good posture but also feels comfortable especially around the mid-back, and most importantly, won't hurt your pocketbook, the basyx VL103 by Hon is worth considering!"

__label2__,The Day Lincoln Was Shot (Tvm),A History of the Assassination,"The Day Lincoln Was Shot, 1998 film<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln and his wife went to a play on Good Friday April 13, 1865. So did John Wilkes Booth. This is a history of that event. At the Surratt Boardinghouse men talk about politics. Booth conspires with his men about capturing Lincoln to exchange for Confederate prisoners. Will it work? Booth the actor has lady admirers, he dances in a ballroom. Lincoln is told he needs more security. Secretary of War Stanton arrives with news of the capture of Richmond. Lincoln wants to visit Richmond. He visits Secretary of State Seward who was injured in a carriage accident. Fireworks celebrate the victory. Lincoln asks the band to play “Dixie”, he plans to welcome the rebel states back. Mary Lincoln shows jealousy and spite. Abraham has a dream about his death. [Do people still believe in dreams?]<br /><br />Lincoln signs pardons for condemned Union soldiers. Lincoln’s son tells about his military experiences. Booth learns about the President’s planned visit to the theater that night and makes plans. Lincoln’s Cabinet recommends harsh punishment for the Rebel leaders, but Lincoln does not want more “bloody work”. They plan to reestablish the courts and the mail system. [Note the dirt roads.] Mrs. Surratt is asked to deliver a package. [This makes part of the conspiracy.] Booth breaks up with Lucy. The conspirators plan to strike at the same time. Lincoln and the Rathbones arrive late. The play goes on. Booth arrives at the theater, a man holds his horse. The other conspirators begin their crimes. There is confusion in the theater! Doctors treat Lincoln.<br /><br />Soldiers arrive. Lincoln is moved to the nearest house across the street. Booth’s leg was injured during his dramatic leap to the stage. Stanton order protection for the Cabinet, the city locked down, and everyone in the theater arrested. The doctors say Lincoln is doomed, he can not survive. Dr. Mudd says Booth’s fibula is broken, he must rest. Itrains in Washington. Lincoln dies at 7:22 AM. “Now he belongs to the ages.” Suspects are rounded up. Twelve days later the Garrett farm is surrounded. One soldier shoots Booth inside a burning barn (Booth shaved off his mustache as a disguise). “Useless” is his last word. The ending credits list what happened afterwards. Mary Surratt was hanged even though there was no conclusive proof of her guilt. [Her son escaped to Europe.] Dr. Mudd got four years as an accessory after the fact. Andrew Johnson became the 17th President, Reconstruction had a vindictive policy towards the South.<br /><br />The northern dominated Congress passed high tariffs on imports which increased industrialization in America. New laws liberalized corporations, they grew in power to form a new aristocracy. [Previously the privilege of incorporation and limited liability were only given to businesses that served the public interest, such as water companies, canals, and railroads.] This is a good history lesson but details had to be eliminated to make this movie fit into its allotted time period. You should read the book for the details that were omitted in this movie. What should be the Reconstruction policy? Harsh punishment for rebellion or a welcome for misguided politics? Machiavelli wrote the duty of a leader was not to chose between the good and the bad but between the bad and the worse; this is one example. You can’t please all of the people all of the time. Abolishing slavery punished the big landowners, those who financed the Confederacy would see their bonds worthless. “A rich man’s war but a poor man’s fight” was one description."

AA batteries fade out while CR123 batteries will die almost immediately.  (implied task:  carry a spare pair)<br /><br />STROBE: easy to use with 3 quick clicks and won't accidentally turn on strobe function when constant light is needed<br /><br />OTHER:  ON button is recessed so that when I rest my M4 rifle on my chest gear it won't turn on.  Also, can take some rain from the inevitable Pacific NW rainshower."
__label2__,iGearPro Multifunctional Voice Recorder - Portable Rechargeable Digital Audio Dictaphone - MP3 Player (8GB),More Useful as an MP3 Player than a WAV Recorder,"I received a free item to review.  The interface is a little quirky; the multi-use buttons could have been better thought out:  The mode/select button is used a lot and I think would function better as a large round button on the front rather than the small push switch on the side - it would also be more comfortable for both right and left-handed users.  The sliding power side switch lies too flush with the case and the texture doesn’t make for an easy grip – you have to really press and push to move it.  I also don’t like that I can’t select Play directly after adjusting the volume. I have to select Stop first – that’s just bad design.  Selecting and deleting files is not as intuitive as I’d like, but the unit was recognized by Windows 7 easily and the folders can be accessed directly.  While the WAV file bit rate isn’t adequate for serious music recording, the recorder works fine as a scratch pad for saving instrumental or vocal ideas. Frankly it’s neither as full-featured nor useful as my Zoom H2 recorder but they’re at different price points and it’s not really fair to compare.  The MP3 Player mode comes with two “C-Pop” recordings of what sound like male and female Chinese vocalists singing English phonetically. The unit’s built-in speaker is not so useful, but the buds sound quite good. Of the seven EQ presets only 3-4 were noticeably distinct to my ears, including the Dynamic Bass Boost.  Overall it makes a compact little mp3 player with decent sound. But a better design and better recording capability would make it more competitive with other products in this range."

It is sturdy and man...does it kick out some heat. I didn't need to push it all the way for my purposes. I used about 1/2 power and had 8 gallons of hose water boiling in 24 minutes! That was with a lid on.<br /><br />When it came time to boil my wort, it worked great. I didn't time it, but it was quickly up to boiling, and I had about 7.5 gallons going. It could easily handle more, I just don't have a pot big enough to test it.<br /><br />The great part is that there is room to grow with this burner. I have a 9 gallon pot that is pretty wide, and I have the adjustable base set to the narrowest setting. I could get a 15 to 20 gallon pot on top of this burner very safely. It is rock solid and can handle a lot of weight.<br /><br />The wind baffles work well, too. It was a relatively windy day, and I was able to adjust the baffles with tilt to keep the wind from affecting the flame too much.<br /><br />I can't tell how much propane it is using up yet, as I have only one batch under my belt, but my calculations tell me that at 105,000 BTU, you will burn through a standard 20 lb. propane tank in 4 hours. As I said, I was probably going half power on the first batch, since I was getting used to the burner...so I plan on 6 to 8 hours of burn time per tank. Time will tell. This should be plenty for a couple of batches, so I am planning on spending about 10 dollars on propane per batch.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this burner...no complaints whatsoever."

__label2__,HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System,Great device for Bluetooth audio!,"Given the high rating of this device on Amazon, I decided to give it a try so I could add Bluetooth capabilities to a mini-system that I keep in the kitchen.  Since buying it, I've been transporting it between other systems in the house.<br /><br />Audio quality seems to be pretty good--not as good as a direct connection, but this is all about convenience.  What really shines is its ability to easily pair with other devices.  I find this receiver with no problems using the Bluetooth built into my laptop.  But with my phone, all I need to do is tap the top of this device with my phone; the phone then enables its own Bluetooth connection, and pairs automatically.  (The magic of NFC, aka near-field communications.)<br /><br />With such easy pairing, and good sound quality, I can't rate this any less than five stars.  It has worked flawlessly for me in the time that I've owned it, and plan on buying at least two more of these in the near future."

__label1__,"Elon Matrix 5,000 - Vitamin for Hair 60 tablets","My husband commented on how good my hair looks since I started this, thick, clear and even toned","My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a ""fat burner"" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)"

__label2__,"Mighty Bright 53510 Orchestra Light, Black (US Adaptor)",The End of All Darkness Worries,"I used this for a theater gig while playing keyboard. The light not only brightened up every inch of the music on the stand but also my entire 88-key keyboard, without blinding a single audience member. The LED lights never produce heat, allowing me to adjust the light at any time without risk of burning myself. The flexible neck allows for any creative positioning imaginable, holding any position for an unlimited amount of time.<br /><br />If there is anything to critique, it is the clip itself, which doesn't hold quite as securely to my music stand as I would hope, though there is no risk of it falling off, it just may wiggle a bit. However, once it is set to my liking, it really only wiggles when I try to do so. No movement occurs just from setting a book on the stand or turning pages.<br /><br />Although I haven't used it for any purposes beside reading music, I'm sure other creative uses would prove effective as well. The option to either use AC power or batteries is very nice, as you don't need to waste battery power when you can conveniently plug it in. Keep a twist-tie or rubber band handy though, as the power cord is quite long.<br /><br />The bag is nice for storing and keeping off dust when not in use. I was attracted to the fact that the light uses cheaper AA batteries as opposed to the more expensive AAA or coin batteries, and it comes with the batteries, too. Considering the quality and all the accessories, I don't foresee needing to spend any bucks on this or any new light for quite awhile."

Pros and cons. Pros you can hang the base on the wall within reach of your favorite source, be it your tv or stereo or whatever and in my case, I have a stereo in the basement and TV and receiver upstairs. The reason I mention this is because. I sometimes hook the set downstairs, put on some cd's or vinyl and sit on the porch and they sound fine (about 30 feet distance) When the wife goes to bed, I connect to the T.V upstairs and listen to the game (loud). It comes with 1/4 adaptor and it comes off leaving the 1/8 inch which fits most computers etc. It has an adjustment setting (3 way) on the base for best frequency and a dial on the headset to make it more clear. In some cases it takes a few minutes to get the settings right. Which brings the Con (or one of them) The volume control is directly above where you adjust the frequency settings so if you're not paying attention you can accidently adjust frequency when you want to turn the volume up. The only other con is (and it's only because it isn't in the manual) is this. If you adjust the headset (as in pull one side down to adjust for your head, You have to put both sides all the way back up before putting the headset on the base for charging. Now this should be obvious but I adjusted my headset and was jamming and dropped the headset. When I went to charge them it wouldn't sit straight on the stand and I thought I bent them by dropping them. I even started pulling the headset a little so it would sit even on the base. It wasn't until I started really looking at the headset on the base where I did the (duh) and walked over and pushed both earpieces up and set it back on the base. It was fine. These are really comfortable as well. These are definitely worth the price and I would buy again. When playing audiophile quality don't expect them to perform like your speakers (if they are a good set) But you can also expect good quality sound for the price - They do the job."

Most of our trouble was trying to get the air out of the tent that had been trapped in it when we took it down.<br />We had a tarp over it through some serious rain and wind, so I can't vouch for leaking issues, but we had a great trip and this tent was a big part of that.<br />I was VERY pleased with this tent."

__label2__,A Death at the White Camellia Orphanage,"Notes while reading ""A Death at the White Camellia Orphanage""","I've finally had a chance to read the first couple chapters of Marly Youmans' Death at the White Camellia Orphanage. People will inevitably call it Faulknerian - it's Deep South, it's hot, it's told through the lens of a boy who's neurologically atypical. And it's got fruit and blood. But if you have any spiritual antennae at all, you'll quickly grasp that it's anti-Faulkner. There's fullness, not emptiness, in back of everything.<br /><br />And the story is backwards, too. Christianity first made its way by claiming the crucifixion and resurrection as the answer to evil. But this novel turns that upside down: in this the novel the crucifixion (at least) is the evil that must be answered. Pip knows at once, in his chaotic, inarticulate way, that everyone is responsible for the death of his brother. The question is, how do you find your way, hobbled with knowing that? Christianity here is the question, not the answer.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />'""Light,"" he whispered. He would collect, slowly and laboriously, a sufficient radiance.'<br /><br />So Pip's story goes on, to the scary parts: where he goes about collecting light. Of course he does, because that's what human beings do: but Pip's working under such a deficit that he has no real thought for what it's going to do to other people, and to himself eventually, if he simply makes up his own rules and plunders it. Here's where the book turns into a book about me, and I find myself reluctant to pick it back up: at twilight the camellia on the cover hovers like a ghost on the end table.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />It takes a long slow weary time to become human, for some of us. ""I preach the Church of the Bitter End and the news of your guilt, boy."" I'm loving Marly's White Camelia: the story of Pip's slow coming-to-humanity cuts close to the bone, for me. It's always been too easy for me to cut free of ties, to shrug and wonder if any of it matters, really, to lose myself in the sheer welter of the senses, the building of patterns and their collapse.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I don't often read novels about myself. Oh, sure, all novels are about me: I am Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, and Ishmael - not to mention Rochester and Micawber and Ahab - and so are you; but that's only because we all are. It's only once in decade, maybe, that I meet myself in a novel in a more personal way, so as to turn red and plus myself non: I didn't know anyone knew this about me. Tolstoy wrote a monstrous great novel about me, calling me Pierre Kirillovich Bezukhov; Trollope once gracefully eviscerated me under the name of Bertie Stanhope. But no one had written about my childhood and coming-of-age, which was a grimmer story than either Tolstoy or Trollope had in mind. Suppose you are a boy of ferocious will and intense desire. Suppose there is an early overwhelming loss, a hole where the center of your life should be. Suppose what is difficult for other people is easy for you, while what's easy for them is impossible: you can solve quadratic equations in your head, but you can't remember the names of the other kids in your classroom. Suppose the sensual world is overwhelming, full of beauties and patterns, while the social world is full of puzzling, trivial detail. Suppose you are awkward, clumsy, irritating: and yet, when whispering time comes, possessed of an eldritch capacity for persuasion. Suppose your own vulnerabilities are so different from other people's that you regularly wound, and are wounded, without anybody meaning any harm. How do you grow up? And how do you recover from a deep, precocious understanding of evil, which - for all your immaturity - marks you as old?<br /><br />Well, by blundering about, and doing a fair amount of damage; by lots of dumb luck, and by the grace of strangers who are extraordinarily generous and kind. That's my story, and it's Pip Tatnall's too. I cared enough about the outcome of this novel that when I was twenty pages from the end I suddenly stopped, and put off finishing it for several days. I was afraid it would end badly, and I couldn't have stood that.<br /><br />It doesn't end badly. But 'nuff said."

For something that is used VERY little, and its ability to quickly move between cars, its well worth it.  Also, I discovered you cannot get features out of this that Honda restricts. One example is MPG. Honda blocks that data thus will not be displayed. This seems specific to Ridgeline, but is likely true to any other make/model that manufacture does not want these settings known. Ridgeline was blocked because the MPG is so low (< 17) they don't want easy to find.  Just my opinion."

__label2__,Sony KDL-32R400A 32-Inch 60Hz 720p LED HDTV (Black) (2013 Model),Great secondary room TV,"Just received the TV today.  Set-up is quick, but there are so many options that the experienced consumer like me can go back and tinker for a long time in all the menus.<br /><br />On the plus side: Only 2.2cents per day to operate; amazingly light(12 lb.s); slim cabinet; easy to use remote control.  It has 'Clear Voice' which is intended to emphasize speech but is helpful only in this function.<br /><br />On the negative side: It DOES work with computers but does NOT have RGB so it's useless for my PC at the moment. I could buy a PC-TV card, but am slightly surprised at this omission.  Also, compared to my Toshiba, it does not do well with 2nd rate signals.  Unless you have HDMI, you'll have an acceptable picture but nothing approaching 'hi def'.  I have it on a simple video/audio RCA connection and its picture is fine, but far from stellar...The major shortcoming on the set, and virtually all sets short of the premium large ones is sound.  A wafer thin plastic cabinet does not provide a means of resonance nor of having proper speakers. As a 2nd set for a room, it's OK; for a primary use set, you should add supplemental speakers, etc.<br /><br />The key thing to remember is no RGB computer hookup. Either you get a HDMI PC card or just use it as a simple TV...it does have USB capability though..."

__label2__,Battlefield 3,Fantastic Gameplay wrapped in horrible lies,"Battlefield 3 was my first foray into the BF/COD realm, and it was a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />I'm a fan of FPS shooters, but I've always been limited to gameplay similar to Half Life, nothing at all like Battlefield, so I was excited to get the game installed, and launched.<br /><br />Origin is an attempt at rooting out Steam as a major digital provider platform. It's not as well polished, and annoying for me to have to install. I figured that I could get used to it, as I was only going to install one game via it (which still made it pointless)<br /><br />From there, I had more issues with several necessary updates, to Origin, the browser, installing security features, being forced to manually update other security components that the programs were unable to do automatedly, and then finally get slapped with an additional massive update patch to the game. All in all, the first day was spent downloading and updating everything.<br /><br />This was also bearable, since the game had just launched. I thought it would be okay.<br /><br />I began having logging in issues. My computer screen would stay black, and I couldn't get into the game. This was disappointing, as it happened at least 3/5 times I logged into a server. While I was able to play, it was great. I was extremely involved in the game. It worked well on my computer.<br /><br />Ultimately, I would have played the game a lot better if the interface leading up to the gameplay was better. Launching from browser is a crap idea, all the levels of security are even more crap. I feel like I'm being manhandled whenever I try to log in, and I feel so distraught by the time I log in, I almost have no desire to play anymore."

__label1__,"Ultra Premium Silicone Swim Cap for Men and Women to Keep Your Hair Dry - Covered by Swim Culture's Industry Leading Lifetime Warranty - Recreational, Competitive and Fitness Swimmers - Lightweight and Comfortable for Adults, Children, Boys and Girls - Greater Durability Than Latex Swimming Caps (Aqua Blue)",Very elastic,"Swim caps in general are a terrible contraption. They are ugly and tight and horrible. That doesn't mean I don't need one so I always look out for the best one there is. I hate the tightness of the swim cap above all. This is why I found this cap from swimculture and decided to try it out. I can't really go to the pool without a cap, because they put lots of chlorine in the waters. It's because so many people visit the pool I bet and many of them are ladies that would clog the whole place up with all the hair.<br /><br />I like this cap because it is very elastic at least. I still look just as ridiculous like all people wearing swim caps (like an alien), but at least I am more comfortable than most of them. My cap is totally smooth and sleek black, so it doesn't draw any attention. My ears and head didn't hurt at all after wearing my cap, so you can see that it is very elastic and nice to wear. If you absolutely have to wear a swim cap at least buy one that is comfortable like this one on this site."
__label2__,Fancierstudio 1000watt Lighting Kit Black White Muslin Backdrop and background stand kit By Fancierstudio K105BW,"Great kit, bad bulbs, solid results","For the price, this kit is a real winner. That said though, the CFLs included in this kit are epic failures. I read some reviews about the bulbs failing or catching on fire, but assumed that would be unlikely. While I didn't have any ""fiery"" experiences, I encountered a close-second when the large 105wt CFL began smoking - yes, literally - and then flickered out moments later. At that time I was more than a bit concerned and went to check the other 105wt bulb and found that the base was incredibly hot (especially for a CFL) and that it too smelled like an electrical fire. I decided to opt for safety and take that bulb out as well. I should also add that the bulbs had only been on for about 30 minutes - which brought their grand lifespan to about 2.5 hours.<br /><br />OK, enough about junky bulbs from China. The rest of the kit: The stands aren't particularly heavy duty, but definitely up to the task for what I need them for - and I think as long as they're treated relative care, you (and I) will get lots of life out of them. I just used them for a video project and the lighting was great. I didn't need to use the backdrops, but found the other stands as a great help for various gear and other clamp lights I use.<br /><br />The backdrops themselves are a bit sheer, but still decent quality considering the overall price of the kit. If you look at them as a ""free bonus"" in the kit, you won't be disappointed - but they won't compare with the better, pricier muslin you can buy. The only concern you'd need to address is lighting behind the backdrops popping through. If you can keep that in check, they will work great.<br /><br />I know it sounds silly, but I was very impressed with the bag - it's a great size, and decent quality. Everything fits right back in the bag without hours of careful planning. Tear the gear down and then stick it in the bag. Zip. Tada! So many bags are the exact size of the equipment, so unless you have a degree in space planning or zippered-duffle-bag management, you're bound to spend a fair bit of time stuffing it all back in there. Not so with this bag - plenty of space for the kit, and I was even able to toss a bag of quick clamps in there and some additional bulbs... yeah, remember those bulbs I mentioned above? Glad I thought to bring backups.<br /><br />So the final verdict? It's a great deal. The bulbs may burn your house or studio down, but if you keep a fire extinguisher handy (or just don't use them at all), you'll be quite pleased to enjoy the nice, even lighting and decent backdrop kit."

Then after about two weeks, the batteries died, eventhough they were only turned on at the four hour setting each evening.  Design needs tweaking for sure."

__label1__,Samson C01UCW Studio USB Mic with Cakewalk Sonar LE (OLD MODEL),"A great, affordable mic","You really can't go wrong with the Samson C01U. It's an incredibly durable mic with a very high standard of functionality and ease of use. Definitely worth the money if you are using it for voiceovers, singing/rapping, or commutation in online games and programs such as skype. I feel this is much better for vocals as opposed to instruments, though I have much more experience with using it for vocals - so take this last sentence with a grain of salt. I haven't used the program that it comes with, Cakewalk Sonar, as I directly use the mic in programs such as Fruity Loops and Ableton where I have mixing plugins available - so I cannot vouch for how good the program is but I can say that it works great with the popular audio creation programs and it is VERY simple to set up - just plug it in and go to your settings of your workspace and active it.<br /><br />Overall, it's definitely worth it. I would give it an 8/10<br /><br />(I think there may also be this same microphone being offered by Samson with a free pop filter and some other goodies, I would suggest that if you don't need Cakewalk)"

__label1__,Starry Lights Mini Sets. 20 Warm White Micro LEDs on 6.5 Foot Silver Wire. Battery Powered With On/Off Switch,Just the right glow for our bikes,"I just bought this awesome starry sets of LED lights, from this seller as a friend recommended me to do so because I had been looking for them at big stores. I did not like what the stores where offering  they looked weak to me, and very low quality. I tried some and they stopped working after a couple of days, and had a too heavy battery pack. I wanted to use them on my bike, to light the wheels, and heavy is not good for that. But these ones I bought here, besides beeing unexpensive compared to the fantastic effect they provide, they are very lightweight, (good for hanging the battery holder on the bicycle), they give just the right amount of brightness for riding on it, the copper wire can be easily adapted to the shape of the wheel, and can be stuck to it with tape easily. I am very happy with them. I contacted the seller as I want more colors, so every kid in the family and my wife can use a different color on their bike. They don't serve them now, but in the future will do. I am going to wait for this brand, as I know for sure I will get a good quality ones. Can't wait to see the other colors."

__label1__,DW DWCP3300 Snare Drum Stand,Totally recommend buying it with the right gear,"I'm 100% satisfied with just about everything about it. And it fits right with my http://fave.co/1bA3TFH  I had only saw the http://fave.co/1bPOFNv in person but I thought for the price and w/ the DW brand behind it the 3500 would be &#34;beefier&#34; looking than it is. The tube diameters are the same as most entry level hi-hat stands. It looks a little diminutive. In my opinion it has a jazz or bebop kit look if that makes sense. Nonetheless seems solid enough and the overall function is really nice.  The pedal action is buttery smooth, tension adjustment is nice, really like the design of the bottom cymbal angle adjuster (no probs. w/ it backing out, all metal, and it's easy to get to), 15&#34; upper rod leaves space for tight overhead clearance and has a &#34;clean&#34; look, no problems w/ the stand staying put despite having a small foot print behind the kit and the locking clutch is a nice touch especially for &#34;harder&#34; players."

The cardboard backing is literally just cardboard, so it starts to bow outward in the middle of the frame after time.  The frame material is pressboard, and it is not rigid at all.  I hung this horizontally and the pull from the hanger wire caused the top and bottom sections of frame to bow outward.  I fixed it by stretching some wire between the top and bottom, but it still wasn't that straight.  I bought a metal frame and threw this in the dumpster.  It's cheap, but I still don't think it's worth the money."

__label2__,Moen 2198 Escutcheon,Did the job,"As always, when ordering parts for anything, the price is ridiculous.  However, we are remodeling the bathroom and wanted to change the faucets from brass and chrome to chrome only.  A new tub faucet and the labor to change it would have been extremely costly.  Ordering the parts to change the entire look of the tub faucet was the best option.  Bought new sink faucets but, since the tub faucet had only been used maybe 40-50 times, it seemed like a good choice.  Again, only reason I am not giving it more stars is because the cost for these little pieces was outrageous."

__label1__,Orbit Watermaster 91922 Twelve-Station Sprinkler System Timer with Remote Control,it is a cheap product,The very first complaint I have is that you cannot secure the zone wires to the controller with any reliability .  They are push connectors and not screw on.  Second the customer support people do not know the product.<br /><br />You cannot skip zones when you have the all zone remote programmed.  In other words you cannot say do all zones skipping the empty ones.  That means that the pump has to run.  I guess if you had a system that did not need a pump you would just time through the zone with no connection and everything would be ok.<br /><br />I am tearing out the system and putting a rain bird system in that has a better range to the remote.  I am on 1 acre property and the unit does not reach 300 feet.<br /><br />Consider purchasing quality and you will not have the headaches I have had.
