[BOS]Five EFFECTIVE Stars![SEP])[SEP]Five EFFECTIVE Stars! This Hallomall Solar Powered LED Outdoor Light is an easy-to-install, solar-powered, rechargeable light for various outdoor security or landscaping lighting needs. It comes with 3 components: the spotlight head which has 4 LEDs, the 5 3/4 inch by 3 1/4 inch by 1 inch thick solar cell, and the 7 1/4 inch long plastic stake for securing it directly into the ground or using included hardware it can be attached to a secure place. I have an almost identical item that illuminates the yard. The difference is the Hallomall light is rated at 200 lumers. When installed it is compact, not taking up much space, less than a foot above the ground in height, and the spotlight angle and the solar cell angle are fully adjustable. There is a push button switch on the solar panel that can be set to &#34;Low&#34;, &#34;Off&#34;, and &#34;High&#34;. It can be used to illuminate walkways, driveways, street addresses, plants, and darkened areas of a yard.  In testing, comparing it to the other, very similar solar LED device staked right next to it, as expected, the 200 lumen Hallomall solar light dramatically &#34;out performed' the 80 lumen 4 LED solar light. When charged for 8 hours, the Hallomall 200 lumen LEDs can put out a circular beam of soft white light that effectively illuminates an area 10 to 15 feet away at approximately 120 degrees circular and it automatically turned on and stayed lit for the entire May night from 8 PM to 5:30 AM, then turned off automatically. When in place, the solar cell and light can be raised or lowered independently of each other at about 45 degrees each. Easy to assemble, easy to install, economical price, solar powered. Highly Recommended. Five BRIGHT Stars. (2 pack of Hallomall Bright Outdoor LED Solar Spotlight, ground stake, installation screws, and instructions. One item was provided for testing and an impartial review.)[EOS]
[BOS]Do Not Resuscitate ventures into the life and mind of an elderly man, Jim Frost, at the beginning of the end of his life.[SEP]I recommend.[SEP]Do Not Resuscitate ventures into the life and mind of an elderly man, Jim Frost, at the beginning of the end of his life. It explores the transition from a past lifestyle that we live today into a future of questionable technology that would make skeptics of religious zealots and atheists alike.  Mixed with humor and irony in a very Vonnegut-like fashion, the author writes his main character, Jim Frost, writing his own biography. Meanwhile his daughter Eliza has signed him up to have his brain downloaded onto a microchip to be saved for some future purpose. Ideally, to be downloaded into a new body.  Toying with the idea of living forever due to such technology, Jim frost remembers his own past for the reader and explores what it means to live in die with stories of family issues, friendly encounters, global evolution, mysterious jobs, and present day elderly life. Bouts of light and dark humor jump out from the text in unexpected moments leaving the reader with wry smiles during a variety of emotional moments.  Personally, I found myself brushing through the pages of an easy read that kept the story new and fresh the whole way through. This isn’t to be mistaken for a sci-fi thriller or expansive adventure. It is a book about life and what humans can very well face in the near future. I am a science fiction fan and I love the idea of both near-future and far future stories(Vonnegut, Asimov). I generally like to read science fiction that provides thought-provoking concepts within a variety of time periods; this is one of those stories.  It is an in-depth expedition into life’s big questions. If you enjoy Kurt Vonnegut, you will enjoy this. I recommend.[EOS]

[BOS]The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it.[SEP]The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series.[SEP]The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />"Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me..."<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series.[EOS]

[BOS]There was a time, not too long ago, when Gold Toe made the best socks that money could buy.[SEP]If someone could recommend a quality sock maker still in business I am all ears.[SEP]There was a time, not too long ago, when Gold Toe made the best socks that money could buy. They were twice or even three times as expensive as the competition, but considering that a pair could be washed and used thirty times or more before wearing out, they were still the best deal in town. Buying 12 pairs at a time, all looking the same of course, would set me for a year.<br /><br />Then a few years ago I noticed something had happened. Gold Toe had become strangely affordable, only somewhat more expensive than the generic brands. The next thing I noticed was after a couple of washes, some of them had shrunk, others had holes in them, and within short just about all of them had worn out. Being a long time Gold Toe fan, i hoped it was just a bad batch, so gave them one more chance. Same thing. I am guessing Gold Toe has, like so many other companies, fired their workers and are simply slapping their label on production runs from the same sweat shops that make the regular generic wear and dispose clothing.<br /><br />I no longer buy Gold Toe as I see little reason to pay extra without getting anything extra. If someone could recommend a quality sock maker still in business I am all ears.[EOS]

[BOS]My 12 year old daughter wanted a violin just out of the blue.[SEP]Yes if she ever learns to play, most likely she'll gravitate to one that will cost more, but for the money every parent can afford to by their kids an instrument to keep them interested in music and learning to play.[SEP]My 12 year old daughter wanted a violin just out of the blue. Violins can be very expensive, yet being able to purchase a new one with colors to choose from for a fickle 12 year old girl at this price was an easy decision.<br /><br />The package came quick with everything expected, and the violin was not cheaply made.

[BOS]The Reactor Gryphon is a great watch that packs the same features as more expensive selections in the "tactical watch" category.[SEP]It's a great watch and I'm happy I spent the $$ on it rather than a Luminox.[SEP]The Reactor Gryphon is a great watch that packs the same features as more expensive selections in the "tactical watch" category.  Its most obvious competitors are the Luminox models.  For an additional $100, you get the Luminox name, but the construction and features of the Reactor make such an expense unnecessary.  It's a great watch and I'm happy I spent the $$ on it rather than a Luminox.[EOS]

[BOS]First off i got to actually play the game for 3 hours straight no problem.[SEP]1 star.[SEP]First off i got to actually play the game for 3 hours straight no problem. Which was the opening day.... for the past couple days i have unsuccessfully not connected to the servers. So i paid $80 for a demo. (i got the digital deluxe edition.) Of what i DID play its awesome....accept that you have to play with other players, NOT TRUE....you can make a private game. Or INVITE ONLY game. The problem with the online server is that only ONE of the dam areas that you can build your city works and you can only build your city on one plot of land. As far as game looks and gameplay, it's excellent. I liked how easy the menus were and its close to the other simcity gameplay. A lot of new things to go along with it too. I HATE that it does not have offline mode, i a member of the armed forces and what i do in my offtime is workout and game, and i love this game and i really dislike that i cannot play it while out to sea or deployed to places that don't have internet. (which is in May) As you all know the servers are not working...So what do you get when you have an Online game that runs on online servers that dont work? a game that doesn't work, and ultimately thats how this review is going to go for this. I paid $80 for 3 hours of working gameplay. Thank you EA and Maxim for delivering so far.. I will update and rate based on the game working....when it is actually working...but until then...1 star.[EOS]
[BOS]Like one of the earlier reviewers, my experience with the rooCase screen protector (i.e., resistance while writing with the S-pen) was very similar.[SEP]So, overall, my experience with this product has been quite negative and this is why I have rated it a 2/5.[SEP]Like one of the earlier reviewers, my experience with the rooCase screen protector (i.e., resistance while writing with the S-pen) was very similar. With this protector, my stylus does not move smoothly due to the friction between the rubber nib and the protector. When writing, the lines are disconnected and sometimes contact is not registered when the stylus touches the screen. This can be quite frustrating and diminishes the value of the benefits of using a digital stylus and, also, having a screen protector (i.e, having to use excessive force to get the stylus to register).    Another issue that I have with the cover, is that when I initially removed it from the package, I noticed that there was a bubble-like indentation (approximately 1-2 mm diameter) in it. Despite this, I decided to still install the protector on my tablet with the hope that the bubble was a temporary anomaly. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The area with the strange indentation is still present and noticeable. Also, when the stylus goes over this area the tablet does not register contact unless I press down quite hard. I am not sure if this was just one item that got by quality control or if this is representative of the quality of rooCASE. Since this was my first time purchasing a rooCASE product, I am definitely a little apprehensive about purchasing future items from this company or recommending them to others.    So, overall, my experience with this product has been quite negative and this is why I have rated it a 2/5.[EOS]
[BOS]I bought one of these as a gift a few years ago and was really impressed with the quality.[SEP]That's a good thing in my universe, as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel (on this Planet, anyhow).[SEP]I bought one of these as a gift a few years ago and was really impressed with the quality. I bought two more of these recently, one black one brown. They are a total disappointment. Both appear to be man made material, not at all the quality of the first one I purchased. If there is any actual leather, it is a very thin layer over cheap man-made material. They not only look cheap, but they feel worse. The color is off and it doesn't even feel good for fake leather. The black one has threads hanging off of several edges that are clearly man-made (there's no stitching on these). Unfortunately I didn't inspect them when I received them, 30 days elapsed and I can't return them. They're so disappointing that I don't even want to keep them as spares no matter how little I paid for them. I hate to just throw them away, but I'd be embarrassed to give them to anyone.   Original review - 1st purchase: This is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back. At full price of 16.99, it is a solid deal. Any lower, and it is a steal. Leather straps are a little tricky to buy online; You can't feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing, and every piece of leather is different. Most of the time with leather straps, you get the quality you pay for. This one appears to be an exception to that rule. But if you are looking for buttery soft fine Corinthian leather with gold stitching, you need to understand that you'll have to pay more. If you want one made from Wild Buffalo Leather or Free Range Mastodon Hide, you'll need to hitch a ride in the Tardis. If all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won't let you down, this is a safe bet. Oh and tight strap button holes? That's a good thing in my universe, as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel (on this Planet, anyhow).[EOS]
[BOS]I have had to replace so many cutting boards because they were porous, moisture got inside and mold grew.[SEP]Definitely worth the price.[SEP]I have had to replace so many cutting boards because they were porous, moisture got inside and mold grew.

I love this style because it has the regular size ball marker (the size of a quarter), but also has a second, dime-sized ball marker (for marking someone else's ball, for example).  It's good quality construction.<br /><br />The four balls that are included look very cheap.  There is an obvious seam on each ball, and the "M" logo's are missing some detail, like it was rubbed off.  I haven't hit them because I don't want to hurt my clubs! (I expect they feel like rocks).  They're nice for display cases, I suppose.[EOS]

However, when I tried VITA RESTORE it maxed out these products. My hair thickened and shines. I've also grown hair for about 2 inches in length which is really great. The dandruff that my previous cream causes now disappeared. And my nails look healthier and growing fast... This is truly one of the best remedies I tried. It's cheaper too![EOS]

[BOS]I have never been to Kodiak Island; I don't own a gun; I don't own a bow: I have never shot a duck, goose, pheasant, wild turkey, deer or elk.[SEP]I am curious to see how the book resonates with a the fairer gender.[SEP]I have never been to Kodiak Island; I don't own a gun; I don't own a bow: I have never shot a duck, goose, pheasant, wild turkey, deer or elk.  I am, and have always been, a city dweller.  My dad did not leave when I was small.  I was not raised by my mother and grandmother.  I am old enough for Sowers to be my son.  One would assume Sowers and I have little in common except our gender.  However, I like real stories about real people.  The stories Sowers tells are real.  Sowers is &#34;real.&#34;  He opens his heart and soul, holds nothing back; his fears, failures, shortcomings, doubts, thoughts.  He puts it all &#34;out there.&#34;  No, actually he brings you &#34;in there,&#34; into his real life, his real feelings, his real everything.  As Sowers permitted me to be a part of his private life, I found myself going in a different direction.  Although I started the journey in to his mind and heart, I found myself walking a different path, my path, my past, my life, my heart, my soul, my failures, my fears, my shortcomings, my questions, deep personal and spiritual questions. At one point I stopped, closed the book, meditated about what I have just read and wondered, &#34;How could someone so &#34;young&#34; have so much insight, wisdom and thoughts that are supposed to occur when you are my age!?  Reflecting upon the book, I have concluded Sowers had some help; divine I suspect.  Although there no &#34;preachy&#34; words or phrases anywhere in the book, make no doubt about it, the book is deeply spiritual.  It comes from a place deep within a writer who obviously has a genuine connection to the Source from which he draws much of what makes this book so special, so relevant, so personal and so vital.  I frankly think his book has something for every man, the best book of its type since Wild At Heart.  But this one will take you deeper within yourself than Wild At Heart.  I am curious to see how the book resonates with a the fairer gender.[EOS]

[BOS]Michael Dirda was for years (decades?[SEP]It may make the author look well-read, but it does nothing for the reader.[SEP]Michael Dirda was for years (decades?) a critic for the Washington Post Book World.  I was aware of this, and also that he was given endless latitude in selecting his topics.  This is the first (and definitely last) book of his that I have read, discovering it at my local library branch sitting on a table.  With a quote from TLS and a reminder that he has a Pulitzer for criticism, it sounded like a promising read.<br /><br />Boy did I loath this book!  I awarded it 2 stars simply because I reserve 1 star for books that are horribly written, which this isn't.  There is nothing technically wrong with the writing.  The author can write a sentence and string several together in a paragraph.  No, I hated this book for the creepy tone and the all-knowing blather.  Call this a self-help book for the intellectually insecure.<br /><br />The assumption behind this book seems to be that there are hordes of people eager to read but utterly clueless about what they should read.  Yes, should read, not want to read.  This is reading as something between castor oil and self-improvement, and reeks of the same white male well-educated superiority that was so popular in the 1950s.  If you liked Adler's Great Books, this is the book for you!  But even Adler limited his all-knowingness to the intellectual realm, instructing the rest of us what we should read.  Not Dirda!  Nope, in addition to endless lists of books we Should Read, he has advice on seemingly all other aspects of life.  "When we consider the ways we might spend our leisure hours...we shouldn't overlook or neglect hobbies and pets."  "Though books can obviously help create a holiday spirit, do not neglect traditional activities.  Listen to Christmas songs on the radio.  Go caroling..."<br /><br />There are over a hundred "literary" quotes that the author has lovingly saved up over a lifetime just waiting, apparently, for an opportunity to foist them upon his starved for education readers.  I'm sorry, but it simply doesn'twork.  One simply can't flit between single sentence quotes of Hobbes, Henry James and Cocteau and benefit from the sampling.  It may make the author look well-read, but it does nothing for the reader.[EOS]

Not just in style, but the quality has gotten better with the time they have made with the way we view time. Their Seiko Sportura watches are definitely in the ranking.

It is a very strong watch that does what it is worth, and protects great  in water. I definitely recommend this watch if you are looking for a great watch that is sporty, and fine like china while telling time.

[BOS]Def not worth low stars or reviews.[SEP]Overall, maybe it's a BIT overpriced and a brain teaser to assemble, but you'll be hard pressed to find something this large and awesome that holds so much for cheaper.[SEP]Def not worth low stars or reviews... This thing is large and solid, perfect for the loft I live in. Fits all of my stuff and I have a pretty extensive wardrobe. Wood is press board, but it's quality pressboard and not a deal breaker. And yes, it's a bit difficult to assemble with some pieces not pre drilled. It took me and a friend about 4-ish hours to put together and we are handy and have contractor tools. If you're gonna spend the $$ on this just spend the extra 100-150 to get a furniture builder or handyman to put together for you. Instructions, when there is something typed out for you which is slim to none... are in Portuguese, made in Brazil. Overall, maybe it's a BIT overpriced and a brain teaser to assemble, but you'll be hard pressed to find something this large and awesome that holds so much for cheaper.[EOS]

[BOS]Mortal Kombat X - Xbox One From a gameplay perspective, Mortal Kombat X easily eclipses everything that's come before it.[SEP]co/1c3tyHJ[SEP]Mortal Kombat X - Xbox One From a gameplay perspective, Mortal Kombat X easily eclipses everything that's come before it. NetherRealm has taken all that they learned in the making of 2011's Mortal Kombat and Injustice: Gods Among Us to create an MK experience to appeal to both casual and hardcore fans.  The &#34;Kollector's&#34; Edition gets good marks too and in addition to the game you also get a Scorpion Figurine by Coarse, Certificate of Authenticity, Gold Scorpion Skin and Kombat Pack Downloadable Content. It might be worth checking out here:  http://fave.co/1c3tmZ7  Mortal Kombat X does play well. Moving back to 2D combat was the best move for Mortal Kombat after some clunky efforts at 3D play from a couple of generations ago, as it has allowed the team to focus on linear combos and giving the attacks a brutal characterisation behind them.  Balancing is good, though it won't take long for each player to find their favorites. I personally became accustomed to Cassie quickly. Partly because I didn't want to be on the receiving end of the ball busting move, but also because she's quick and her attacks have good flow to them. I found the bigger, heavier characters to be almost unmanageable in how clunky their attacks flowed together, but of course the first time I jumped online I ran into someone who showed me what those characters were capable of (and left me with a shredded Cassie to show for the lesson).  It remains a very accessible fighting game, with relatively small move lists for each character, though at the start of each battle it's possible to select from three different "stances”, which effectively means that each character is three different play styles in one.  The complete list of characters in the game, some of which are classics include: Baraka, Bo' Rai Cho, Cassie Cage, D'Vorah, Daegon, Ermac, Erron Black, Ferra & Torr, Fox, Frost, Fujin, Goro, Jackson Briggs, Jacqui Briggs, Jason Voorhees, Johnny Cage, Kabal, Kano, Kenshi, Kitana, Kotal K'etz, Kotal Kahn, Kuai Liang, Kung Jin, Kung Lao, Li Mei, Liu Kang, Mileena, Nightwolf, Predator, Quan Chi, Raiden, Rain, Reptile, Sareena, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shinnok, Shujinko, Sindel, Smoke, Sonya Blade, Kurtis Stryker, Suchin, Takeda Takahashi, Tanya, Taven, Tremor  In short I'd recommend picking yourself up a copy of:  http://fave.co/1c3tyHJ[EOS]

[BOS]It's a piece of junk![SEP]So, that was a total of $12 to get a replacement.[SEP]It's a piece of junk!  My son had seen the commercials for what looked like such a fun and exciting new toy. I was thrilled to find one at Target. It ended up being such a let down....My son's spirits were as deflated as this stupid balloon.  I bought one at Target (for a fraction of the cost that people are asking on Amazon and eBay). I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles. How convenient! They include a note: "Lifetime replacement warranty" "Do not return to the retailer." Only problem, they want $7 "handling fee." Plus the cost of postage to mail it back, which ended up costing me another $5. So, that was a total of $12 to get a replacement.[EOS]

[BOS][[VIDEOID:c2df505db83f0cbd75f4a819155d06ef]]Do you want Power more than anything else from your headlamp?[SEP]Recommended    This product was sent to me to test and review for you online shoppers.[SEP][[VIDEOID:c2df505db83f0cbd75f4a819155d06ef]]Do you want Power more than anything else from your headlamp? At anywhere near this price, this is it. Let me tell you about this headlamp, and I purchased my first one just like this one six months ago, so I know about them.    You're going to get a reasonably comfortable band, that can be improved on by wearing an athletic  headband under it. I think that it will adjust to anybody's head on this third rock from the sun and it works well.    On the back of it, is the power pack containing two, included 18650 batteries. I did a capacity test on them and they were measured at about 1200mAh, so the two will last quite a while, 3-5 hours or more on Low, but I'm using two 3100mAh in mine that test at over 3200mAh and now it really lasts.    This pack includes a USB port to charge it or any other device that you charge USB, and this comes with a wall charger for the pack too, so it arrives ready to charge and use. The pack has a rubber cover to pull off to insert the batteries and it stays attached by a little ring, so you won't drop or misplace it.    On the front is the lamp and it's got a magnifying lens. This lamp is what really rocks about this, it uses a good, white XM-L2 LED with a lot of output. I've never owned a more powerful headlamp and this will provide daylight at about 75 feet. It will also provide a huge, bright flood of light at 25 feet. You'll twist the ring on the light like a camera zoom, for magnification.    This uses a 5 setting switch with memory and you will need to click this one to cycle through them. It's High-Medium-Low-Strobe-SOS, and if you're on Medium and shut it off, it will remember to turn back on Medium, unless you don't wait long enough, in which case it would then cycle to Low.    This is very wide magnification that this lens is using, so it won't shine quite as far as my fixed lens flashlights like it, but this is still so much light that you will like this lamp, guaranteed.    Everything about this is okay, except that I really wish that they would have made the tilt more adjustable, you'll get four positions with three usable. These batteries work fine but you'll like it even better with an upgrade to higher rated ones. You might not get more than half a phone charge from these batteries, unless they are fully charged, and of course they won't power the light as long either. I'm using [[ASIN:B00O9XLOW2 These Batteries]], which cost more than the light does today, but it's 6400 vs 2400mAh and I could top off my phone twice and still have hours of light. 18650 batteries will recharge 500 times, so expensive batteries are cheap in the long run, it will depend on how often you charge them, but maybe only $2 a year. It's something to consider, mainly if you do want to charge a device from this or will use the headlamp where you can't charge it again for days.    Now after owning two of these headlamps, I love them twice as much. There are a few nits to pick, but this kind of Power at this price, fagetta bout it.    Recommended    This product was sent to me to test and review for you online shoppers.[EOS]

[BOS]This tv/monitor has amazing resolutions and picture quality.[SEP]I hope this review helps people.[SEP]This tv/monitor has amazing resolutions and picture quality.  However, it doesn't work well out of the box.<br /><br />1.  Do not use the included HDMI cable.  Do.  Not.  That's the cause of all of the blacking out that the tv has a reputation for.  It's what drove the price down so much from what it started off with.  I've heard that some people have problems with HDMI port 3 (it's the most accessible port, on the left side of the screen) but I switched out the HDMI cable and used that port and I haven't had any problems since.  The HDMI 1.4 is still a regular size HDMI cable.  That's just the speed of the data so if you already have an HDMI cable, use that.  There's no need to buy a new one.  You'll probably be very impressed with the included cable at first because it looks and feels so high-quality.  I couldn't stop oohing and ahhing over it.  However, it's a piece of junk.  Don't even bother unwrapping it.  As a matter of fact, give it to your worst enemy as a gift.<br /><br />2.  Upgrade the firmware, I've used both the 39&#34; and 50&#34; UHD versions.  I switched because I was still having blacking out problems but that stopped after I changed the HDMI cable.  Don't use Seiki's instructions on updating firmware.  Download the firmware on a FAT32 formatted usb stick (any Sandisk one is pre-formatted, you don't need to delete what's already there).  Then put the stick in the USB  port in the tv and turn it on.  Press menu on the remote and 0000.  Then upgrade the firmware.  It could take up to two minutes.<br />http://www.seiki.com/support/downloads.php<br /><br />3.  Go to this address and download 2 things, the custom resolution program, and the pixel patcher.  http://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU?page=1<br /><br />4.  Make sure you read all of the notes on that site, particularly in regards to either deleting Geforce Experience (if you have a Geforce card) or turning off some app in Chrome.  I didn't do that at first and itcaused all kinds of problems.<br /><br />5.  You add and edit resolution in the Nvidia Control Panel or CCC depending on your card but then you apply those resolutions in the regular display dialog box by right clicking on the desktop, going into advanced settings, and list all modes.<br /><br />5.  Check around for settings that have worked for other people with regards to sharpness, color, etc.  Everyone says turn sharpness to 0.  That's what I have mine on that and I'm satisfied with it.<br /><br />I will say that the text looks clearer than pre-4k but the computer monitor colors look a little washed out but only when surfing the net.  When watching movies online or playing games, it doesn't appear washed out at all.  Games look amazing on this.  I mostly play games like State of Decay, Fallout, etc.  Plus, some city building games like Civilization.  I notice some very slight mouse lag when using it to surf (not game) but I had previously read about it so I switched to an optical mouse beforehand so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />I've played everything from 420p to 4k and it always looks great, after the changes mentioned above anyway.  Do not freak out about the quality of the tv until you've done everything mentioned above.<br /><br />Also, the stand that it comes with does not work very well for me.  Right now, my setup looks very haphazard with me using an old shelf to support the tv in the front.  Otherwise the tv would be tipping over.  It's just as well though because the tv doesn't give me enough keyboard room for my desk so I now use the shelf as a keyboard shelf.<br /><br />For those of you who believe the hype about 4k being better than 3D, it is not.  A TV/monitor that is both 4k and 3D is better than 3D. 4K, by itself, is just a really high definition tv.  No more, no less.  The images look much cooler, definitely, but are not nearly as surreal as 3D.  I just kept looking at it and thinking about those photos that people have blown up and use as mural size paintings.  That's the effect of 4K to me.<br /><br />Using the steps above, I am able to get 4K @ 30, 1440P @ 60, and 1080P @ 120.  Video is upscaled even without using the UHD adapter that Seiki sells.  Supposedly, I should qualify for a free one with the purchase of this tv but I haven't ordered it yet.<br /><br />By the way, my setup is a Vishera 6350 FX CPU, 32 GB Ram, and a Geforce GTX 650 (non-ti) graphics card.<br /><br />I hope this review helps people.[EOS]

Each console is hooked up to a LG 47&#34; LED TV. The video quality is fantastic but the sound left a lot to be desired. This &#34;problem&#34; needed a solution.   I set four simple goals to address this.  1) The system had to sound great. 2) High Wife Acceptance Factor. :) 3) I did not want to run a separate A/V receiver. I simply don't have the room. 4) I did not want to run wires under the baseboards or carpet.  To achieve these goals I decided to build a complete Sonos Home Theater System, with the new PLAYBAR front and center (literally).  Here are the components I chose for my system:  - Sonos BRIDGE - Sonos PLAYBAR - Sonos SUB - Sonos PLAY:3 (x2 as Surround Speakers)  Let's start with the setup. First thing I did was download the Sonos software for my laptop and hooked up the Wireless BRIDGE to my router. After the software downloaded and installed, getting the BRIDGE recognized by the software was as simple as pressing a button.[EOS]

[BOS]I have been drinking lipton iced tea for what seems like forever.[SEP]Plus it is literally the only tea I've tasted that actually rivals lipton without even adding any sweetener to it, really really good.[SEP]I have been drinking lipton iced tea for what seems like forever. If you drink a lot of tea, then the packaging is perfect for you. Everyone in my family drink iced tea so it is nice to be able to quickly and easily make a gallon without much mess. I would also recommend this iced tea mix, [[ASIN:B009PIEW3O 100% Pure Instant Iced Tea Powder (Unsweetened) 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]. It comes in a resealable foil bag so whether you want to make a bunch or just a cup its quick and easy to do.

[BOS]I was quite disappointed with this product.[SEP]Even with heavy daily use they all still have held up well.[SEP]I was quite disappointed with this product.<br /><br />With the filters I was hoping that clean up would be easier than my [[ASIN:B0064A7SRS Ekobrew Cup,Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers 2-Pack - BROWN $ GREEN]].  -- Alas it was not.<br /><br />This Melitta system also does not hold as much grounds as the Ekobrew --  it is a very small amount however makes a BIG difference in the taste / strength of the coffee.  So I suspect it is both the amount of grounds the cup holds as well as the Ekobrew being able to extract more flavor due to  how water passes through the grounds.<br /><br />I also like the Ekobrew better because it is 100% reusable.  This Melitta system while initially a lot less money does use disposable filters which add to extra cost.<br /><br />While the Ekobrew costs a bit upfront it is worth it.  I have an Ekobrew for over a year and have had no problem with it (note I have about a 12 and use 2-3 every day).  Even with heavy daily use they all still have held up well.[EOS]

Of course $100/item is absurd for an aunt to spend (sorry but it isn't going to happen). I found this scooter on Amazon and thought she would love it. Sure enough, it was a hit. The only thing to be wary of is keeping her 2 yr old brother away from it. He wants to ride the scooter. Of course it's too small for him but so far the toy hasn't been broken yet![EOS]
[BOS]I got this treadmill hoping I could start being active and working out regularly but sadly I wasn't able to with this.[SEP]You won't regret getting the one I did, it's just not possible.[SEP]I got this treadmill hoping I could start being active and working out regularly but sadly I wasn't able to with this. The first thing I noticed was the fact that the plastic pieces on it felt very cheap and low quality for the price it's being sold. I felt that I didn't receive a well made product that they advertise. Also, it would randomly shut off during use and would lose all of my progress during a specific work-out. This happened no matter where I plugged it in.<br /><br />After I dealt with that, I did some research like I should have from the start and found a treadmill here on Amazon that I absolutely love. I've had it for about a month now and can't find a single thing to complain about. It feels well made and does exactly what it should. I use it as much as I possibly can and have never been happier with my health.<br /><br />If you want a great elliptical, get the same one I did here on Amazon -----------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1oJZdAr<br /><br />You obviously get what you pay for when it comes to this kind of stuff and I hope I can help keep others from making the same mistake I did in buying a bad machine. You won't regret getting the one I did, it's just not possible.[EOS]
[BOS]Being that I only really purchase Sony televisions, picking the brand of blu-ray player was simple.[SEP]vote/gp/product/B00TYFCJOM[SEP]Being that I only really purchase Sony televisions, picking the brand of blu-ray player was simple.   Sony  Sony has finally provided a Blu-Ray DVD player for dedicated Sony users. The player itself is incredibly lightweight. The top of the player has a small touchpad that allows you to control the player easily in-case you lose the remote. The remote is standard as far as Sony products go. If you're unfamiliar with Sony electronics: all remotes works for all products.  That means this remote works for my television as well as the blu-ray player. And, indeed, this was the case. I use it with this awesome TV http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00HPMCNXI  PERFORMANCE The (high definition) Blu-ray movies played on the DB-D5500 are fabulous. (Standard low definition) DVDs are much clearer than played on my old DVD player. Nothing more needs to be said.  PROS/CONS 1) The BD-D5500 has a loading tray, which encourages proper handling of the disks by the edges. (Many more expensive players are &#34;slot loading&#34;) 2) The controls are touch (not buttons)---sometimes a quick tap is good enough, sometimes it is not. I greatly prefer the tactile feedback of buttons. I find it very annoying that if I tap too quickly, nothing happens; if I tap too slowly, it &#34;double-reads&#34;, e.g. &#34;open-close&#34; and never opens; or &#34;on-off&#34; and never turns on. Note that &#34;tactile feedback&#34; could be supplied by a built-in clicker that you would both hear and feel---simple cheap technology. 3) Although I don't need it, I think that it is absurd that the optional wireless adapter costs as much as the player, when Sony could surely build-it-in for $5 more. 4) Sometimes the player remembers where you paused a movie, sometimes it doesn't. 5) Despite the complaint of one reviewer, it is the standard width (17&#34;), exactly the same as my old DVD player and my receiver. 6) The controls are illuminated, and so, easy to operate even in a dark room, but the controls are identified only by symbols. Seeing in the dark is good, feeling in the dark would be even better---that is, with my old Sony DVD player, the button on the far left was on/off, the button on the far right was open/close---so I did not even have to look at the panel to know what button to push. In my opinion the Sony was more ergonomically designed.  If you're hot to trot, like I was use Amazon Prime's 30 day free trial. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00EW0FYA0 In the end if you get this, you'll be pleased http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00TYFCJOM[EOS]

[BOS]This is the perfect solution for camping.[SEP]Im a fan of these and will make sure I always have them camping.[SEP]This is the perfect solution for camping.  When you need to pee in the middle of the night, its a hassle to get up, put on some clothes, find your flip flops, and trek outside to pee.  (I will admit its usually really enjoyable when you have a cool, clear night and are looking up at the stars!)  Kept a couple of these in my tent when camping last weekend and Ill be honest, it was great to essentially just stay in bed.  It took some care and precision, but was very manageable.  I found that my bags do NOT have a &#34;ziploc&#34; top, but the material solidifies quickly with no odor, so I just kinda set it to the side - no big deal.  Im a fan of these and will make sure I always have them camping.[EOS]

Once you try a daylight bulb, you may never go back  to the yellow incandescent light again. Compact florescent lights also are made in daylight versions. Check the internet for a circular stand for diamond paperweights.  My paperweight measured 2 1/4&#34; instead of 2&#34;.[EOS]

[BOS]I needed an insulated coffee mug, so I got several brands to try out.[SEP]Hope you enjoy them also.[SEP]I needed an insulated coffee mug, so I got several brands to try out. This Epare is my favorite by far. It's a generous size and attractive design. It's as rugged as these can be and has lasted quite well. It hasn't leaked at all so far although I always hand wash it since it's so quick that way. I confess I broke one when I tipped over a blender jar and it unfortunately landed on my Epare but I can't blame the mug at all for that. It keeps my morning coffee nice and hot a lot longer than my other non-insulated mugs. One thing I noticed is you don't want to fill it all the way to the top or a little drips down the side with the first few sips. Just leave a half inch and you should be OK. It has this in common with the other brands I tried. I liked these enough to buy another set. Hope you enjoy them also.[EOS]

[BOS]OK - I read all the reviews up to this.[SEP]This is really a great bang-for-the-buck at $268 (WM).[SEP]OK - I read all the reviews up to this.  I surveyed all (well....many of.....) the 32-inch HDTVs out there. At least the ones in the "budget" category.  I went to Best Buy.  Went to Wal-Mart.  I stood back.  I stared.  I reviewed specs and stats.  I vacillated between going "cheap" (a.k.a. "no name" or "somewhat familiar" name) and famous "name brand".  I run a moderately-sized independent inn  (hotel) with 20 rooms and needed to make a wise purchase.  I have a 65" LG 3D TV at home purchased last Christmas through Amazon.  Love it...but after the "dust settled" in this 32-inch category.....I looked at prices and caught a sale at WallyWorld ($268)....with Best Buy matching it....I bought 20 of these babies.  Samsung....not LG.  WHY?..you ask?<br /><br />First....there is NO such thing as a non-"flimsy" TV base.  After taking the very first one out of the box...I saw part of the "shaky problem".  The metal frame and the shiny black plastic overlay do not fit perfectly together with every TV.  NO BIGGIE.  I estimated the engineering issue at about 1/32"-1/64" of "play...front to back.  Solution? I got a cheap roll of RUBBER electrical tape (not vinyl), cut ONE 1-inch piece and tacked it on top of the base-bottom rubber pad (rear one).  VOILA.  No...more....wobble....or shake.  Sure....this COULD have been prevented with better production of the metal base and plastic molding....but what is....is.  C'mon people!  No need to bellyache....look for solutions!  It now has NO wobble.  Yeah...make sure that you "crank" in the 7 screws so they bottom out....and a slight extra crank.  You're done.  Attach your coax.....attach the power cord.....turn it on.....click...click....click.....wait for the channels to memorize (if you have cable, etc.) then wait the 10-15 minutes of plug-in-play programming to finish up.  Program the date and time.  Enjoy your TV.  Samsung has a great rating for a reason.  Clean.  Bright.  Crisp.<br /><br />Oh...the LG was my second choice....but I preferred the brightness/vibrancy of this Samsung.  Plus the "swoopy" design of the lower part of the TV frame in front seemed more "modern". I DO wish that there was a volume limiter option...but, alas....this is a consumer-grade TV...not an overpriced "hotel grade". SUPERB VALUE at this price point.  Oh....don't sweat the 60Hz vs. 120 or the 720p vs. 1080p.  At 32 inches.....your eyes/brain will HARDLY know the difference.  Sorta like the difference between 87 and 92 octane.  You'll hardly notice.  Except for the $50-$100 dollar difference.  I noticed THAT! BTW, there is NO "tilt" on this base.  I have NO idea where THAT previous comment came from....<br /><br />I may write more as time goes by.  For now....I have 12 more TVs to install.  Anyone want twenty-three 27-inch, 60lb CRT (tube) prehistoric TVs?  Goodwill, here I come....<br /><br />UPDATE 11/9/12:  I am still VERY please with this TV.  I have the open-box-to-all-set-up process down to 5 minutes (plus the self-programming which takes about 15 minutes).  Indeed, there is a consistent, very SLIGHT off-level issue with the stand base.  One 1-inch slice of rubber electrical tape on the REAR bottom pad is all it takes.  There are NO issues with ill-fitting screws AT ALL.  Just eat your spinach beforehand so you can put a bit of "umph" in your final twists - they are self-tapping. This is really a great bang-for-the-buck at $268 (WM).[EOS]

The ordering instructions say that this windshield is for the factory frame, but did not give the measurements, somewhere in the blogs I read 40.5 wide, and 36.25 high, if your frame has these measurements, as mine did, it should fit perfect, and yes it is easy to install once you see the video, or easier yet if you are replacing a existing windshield already on the cart.

As with most hollow bodies it goes out of tune after heavy string bending leads.

If you dont play bluesy bendy leads this is as good as any guitar out there. If you do. Keep a second 6 string by the stage so when you come out of that solo you are playinbg diminished chords...lmao[EOS]

[BOS]Let's be honest.[SEP]Just not front and center.[SEP]Let's be honest... this thing is really chintzy. It's much bigger than I expected (I was expecting something the size of a book, but it's really the size of a poster), but the fabric is really thin and flimsy, and the printing on it is atrocious- it looks like someone tried to stencil on the Hufflepuff crest but the paint bled under the stencil. It's pretty ugly, to be honest. If I had known how poor the quality was, I would have never have gotten it.<br /><br />However, my 9 year old is a loyal Hufflepuff (she got sorted into that house and has been obsessed ever since) and ANYTHING having to do with Hufflepuff makes her happy, so the banner was a welcome addition to her room. Just not front and center.[EOS]

[BOS]I love this product for several reasons.[SEP]The benefits outweigh the price of this charger/usb cable.[SEP]I love this product for several reasons.<br /><br />First, it is multi-functional. It's a charger and a data cable.  It allows me to put in on charge and not get the annoying pop up and when you switch to USB mode, you can transfer you pics, music, files, downloads to your laptop or pc.<br /><br />If your USB and charger still works this is a convenient spare. I travel a lot so i just keep this in my travel  bag and im always prepared. We've all had a cable or two missing when you actually need them.  and for $6 dollars you can not worry about that.<br /><br />This cable is compatible with any brand of computer or laptop. You don't have to worry about getting gadgets of the same brand.<br /><br />The benefits outweigh the price of this charger/usb cable.[EOS]
[BOS]I saw this movie nearly two years ago and have watched 150+ movies since, yet it haunts me with its beauty.[SEP]Oh and don't forget to bring some tissues![SEP]I saw this movie nearly two years ago and have watched 150+ movies since, yet it haunts me with its beauty.  It was playing at a film festival that I attend annually and was my favorite out of more than 25 movies I caught that year.  First off, this movie was especially well written.  If you are tired of the regurgitated swill that Hollywood increasingly produces this will definitely appeal to you.  As you watch the movie, the characters are well developed and honest.  They could be your neighbor or a friend.  The acting was exceptional and believable as an elderly man slowly loses his ability to connect with the world around him.  But beware -things are never what they appear on the surface.  If you like a good love story that doesn't need sex and violence to "enhance" your enjoyment, this qualifies as an experience to be savored.  The plot line is well developed but provides a surprise that few will foresee.  Furthermore, several of my movie friend's stated that when watching it a second time, you catch greater subtleties within the premise of the movie and that they actually enjoyed it even more.  What could be a greater endorsement from serious movie aficionados?!  It's a definite must see, in fact, I enjoyed this as much as "Love Story".  Oh and don't forget to bring some tissues![EOS]

Unfortunately, that machine was a pain to set up and the thread came out way too easily. It was frustrating for us both since it interrupted her creativity and I was the one that had to keep rethreading it. I'm not familiar with sewing machines at all, but I knew if we didn't get something simpler for my daughter to use, she might lose her interest. Fortunately, we were able to try out the new Singer 1304 Starter Basic and it's been a better choice for my daughter so far. It doesn't have super fancy stitches or LCD displays, but it is simple to set up and operate. It's also pretty compact in size so it fits in the small area we've dedicated for her crafting. She hasn't had the time to use it extensively, but as time passes, I'll try to update this review with more of our experience with the Singer 1304.[EOS]

Let it defrost a few minutes than cut it in half (they're cut already but not all the way through).  Butter it lightly and put it in the toaster over for maybe 3-4 minutes until it starts to lightly brown.  Then I like to add some strawberry jam or another flavor.  Delicious!  To market these only to gluten free people is a mistake.  And they need to get them in more stores more frequently.[EOS]

[BOS]The sixth book of the Half-Blood princess will bewitch you with its story of the continuing battle between good and evil involving Sophia and her friends.[SEP]Overall this book is a fascinating addition to the Half-Blood Princess series.[SEP]The sixth book of the Half-Blood princess will bewitch you with its story of the continuing battle between good and evil involving Sophia and her friends.<br /><br />The author continues to focus the story on the plot of the book with the romance supporting the plot.  The love scenes are still sizzling while remaining well written and tastefully done.<br /><br />This story is fast paced and is more active than the last one, so be prepared to finish the story before you put it down.  As a new front on the battle scene emerges, the plot grabs your attention and refuses to let you go.<br /><br />While the book has a couple of violent scenes, violent the author has achieved getting the violence across without being graphic or tasteless.  I was very impressed with one really violent scene that had the potential to be nasty.  The author kept the intensity of the scene without being excessively graphic.<br /><br />There were a couple of minor grammatical errors that get lost in the story.  Overall this book is a fascinating addition to the Half-Blood Princess series.[EOS]
[BOS]The watchband on my [[ASIN:B000FGC4QM old analog sport watch]] had become tattered, so it was time to upgrade it or get rid of the watch.[SEP]But it does serve as a reminder to all of us to check the specs carefully before ordering a product.[SEP]The watchband on my [[ASIN:B000FGC4QM old analog sport watch]] had become tattered, so it was time to upgrade it or get rid of the watch. But why trash a perfectly good timepiece that had proven itself to be so reliable since I had purchased it new here back in 2008? As they say, "It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."      Started searching for a decent 20mm sports watchband that was reasonably priced and not designed to look [[ASIN:B005BKPS9C too weird]] on my watch, as are some of them. Maybe I'm too conservative, but there were [[ASIN:B002Z367CK some]] that just weren't my style. Contemplated a stainless steel link band, such as this [[ASIN:B001EYVBAY Hadley-Roma Men's 20-mm Stainless Steel Watch Bracelet]], but had to rule it out as I didn't know how it would look on my old favorite watch.      By chance I found this [[ASIN:B003U98VHC AllStrap 20Mm Black Sport Leather-Contrast Stitch Watchband]] and it seemed to be a decent choice, though it was called a long length band in the specs, and I have an average wrist. Still, it's better to have one a bit long than too short, and considering that the price was reasonable, ordered it here. When it arrived a couple of days later (and thanks, Amazon Prime), took it out of the package and looked it over. It did indeed have a 20mm band width, came with a pair of replacement stainless steel spring bars, and easy to see that it was black leather... but it appeared to be a slightly different product from the one here in the photos. The end wasn't pointed as is shown in Voguestrap's product photos, but more of a squared end sport strap similar to that on the [[ASIN:B001F0PTPK Hadley-Roma Men's MSM881XA-200 20-mm Black Oil-Tan Leather Watch Strap]], if their image is correct.      The other thing that was different was that the band is slightly padded, and not flat, and the buckle is not the shiny one as pictured. The one that I received had a brushed steel look, as one can see in the photos that I've posted here.      Allsaid and done, I like this band more than the one that's there in Voguestrap's product photos. But it does serve as a reminder to all of us to check the specs carefully before ordering a product.[EOS]

So far, not a single fingerprint or smudge has appeared, like were on the screen before. I highly recommend this item!

I was very exited to install this grill so I went into my garage and........talk about a letdown. It is NOT an exact fit even though the product page on Amazon says it will fit my car. The problem is that the longest horizontal bar (they are not all the same length) is about 1/8 inch wider than the hood scoop on each side. Fortunately, I have a bench grinder and after a few minutes worth of grinding, it now fits inside the hood scoop as it should have to begin with. I gave it 4 stars because I am very happy with the look but not with the fact that it required modification.<br />P.S. My hood scoop is factory so I am puzzled as to the poor fitment.  The areas that are ground are hidden inside the scoop so they cannot be seen but care should be taken so as not to damage the polished surfaces. All in all, the look is great[EOS]

[BOS]When I first looked into portable nailers, I was drawn at first to the Paslode as I noticed virtually every trade had one of these on the back of his truck.[SEP]After my wife recovers from the shock of this, I'll be looking for either the 15 or 16 gauge fusion.[SEP]When I first looked into portable nailers, I was drawn at first to the Paslode as I noticed virtually every trade had one of these on the back of his truck.  But I realized as a homeowner, that the cylinders would eventually be a problem one way or another; I don't use them fast enough, and I don't want to keep a supply around.  Don't get me wrong, I think the Paslode is a great system, but I was looking for something that would be more or less a charge-and-go tool.<br /><br />The Senco had some absolutely outstanding reviews on the web and in homebuilding magazines.  I wanted to try one in person, but even near a big city, these tools are not commonly carried at the dealers (and the ones that do have them don't want to take them out of box and try them).  The push for me was the rebate ending in August, and I decided for my work, the 18 gauge would suit me best.<br /><br />It arrived Thursday night, and I've been using it for the extended labor day weekend.  And despite my fears that this tool wouldn't work as people described, by the end of the weekend, I was won over.<br /><br />Its a big tool, but you can maneuver it okay.  I first used it to complete the shoe molding in the bath I was renovating.  5 minutes later it was done. Perfect, and with 18G brads, you don't even really have to putty the holes they're so tiny.  And the molding was oak, and it left the brads just below the surface.<br /><br />Next job was weather stripping around the garage.  I was a little skeptical that 18G brads would work, but they worked great.  I let my son do all the nailing and I did the cuts.  He just smiled and said "Hey dad, anything else I can nail with this thing?  This thing is fun".<br /><br />Finally this morning, my daughter was building a cabinet to hold cosmetics (no, I did not make that up), and we got out the Senco Fusicn.  Fastening 1/4" furniture grade plywood?  A real test of placement  A little tricky, but perfect placement every time.  This is the stuff you typically try to fasten with a nail and hammer.  No more.<br /><br />So what is the downsides?  Its expensive.  Its on the heavy side.  And It takes experience to understanding where the brad will go in.  And on soft material, the safety mechanism can dent the wood.<br /><br />On the plus side, the battery charges in under an hour, it has a decent bag (although the hard case would be better, especially if it had a holder for all your brads), an LED lights up things in dark corners, the brads used are dead-standard Senco type nails, so I found them at my local corner hardware store, and the thing just works.<br /><br />Final Note:  18G brads may take the place of your 16G finish nailer for many things.  It works real well.<br /><br />After my wife recovers from the shock of this, I'll be looking for either the 15 or 16 gauge fusion.[EOS]

Clear plastic makes touch controls a little iffy. I think working with it and using it some will get me accustomed to the pressure needed to be able to affect touch control activations. May help in making the clear plastic a bit more pliable, which might help the cause, too.<br />Put iPhone in upside down (home button toward the top) so that when using the phone, it's oriented correctly.  This also ensures that the camera lens is not obstructed.[EOS]
[BOS]I'm not thin but I'm not morbidity obese.[SEP]One of those weighted as much as the five of these did total.[SEP]I'm not thin but I'm not morbidity obese. I bought these to replace carpet casters. They look slightly flimsy when I opened the bag but thought nothing of it. After getting all five casters on my chair one broke. Then the other four when. Ended up getting a set that cost ten times as much. One of those weighted as much as the five of these did total.[EOS]
[BOS]This works perfectly.[SEP]This is far superior than any other solution I've found for shock absorption.[SEP]This works perfectly.

It does a bunch of stuff I could care less about but makes it that much cooler for him. The design is nice and sporty but sleep and sexy at the same time. It curves around your wrist to make it more comfortable. It is very heavy for a watch but that should be expected with what this bad boy does.[EOS]

[BOS]Superb for holding our medium-weight rug to the floor, love it![SEP]***[SEP]Superb for holding our medium-weight rug to the floor, love it! Seriously, wife and I both tried to do the "Tom Cruise slide" (ala Risky Business, remember that one?) on the rug and nodda, no budging to be had - awesome!    Just got it so, will come back and update later if anything changes though I highly doubt it will. I will say that I'm at least mildly concerned about any of this type of pad leaving permanent waffle marks on the finish of the wood, but we figured it didn't much matter since we bought the house recently and the floor is already in fair to partly cloudy shape as far as needing refinishing anyway.    *** Update -- One month later and, still no sliding - YEAH!!! ***[EOS]
[BOS]I picked the Casio AE1000W as a cheap beater watch for traveling and work and it's performed admirably given the price I paid.[SEP]It's not terribly slim, but it's got that great intersection of price and plenty of features that it's hard not to recommend.[SEP]I picked the Casio AE1000W as a cheap beater watch for traveling and work and it's performed admirably given the price I paid. I've owned it for a year. It is a fairly large watch with a resin band so it may feel a little odd if you have slender wrists, but it is very lightweight. The current watch face does have a few small scratches over the course of my time using it but they're not particularly bad and everything else has held up well. It's done fine given that this is essentially my beater watch.<br /><br />The World Time features are nice and easy to use. You can select 5 time zones as your most frequent time zones for the primary timekeeping mode and then easily change the main time zone out as needed. It's particularly nice because you can easily turn DST on or off for any one time zone. It's also been holding time quite well.<br /><br />The 5 alarms are useful - They can be set to be single use or recurring which makes them nice for simple reminders or as a backup wake-up alarm (although it's a little quiet if you're a heavy sleeper). The digital timer is a very useful feature and the stopwatch works as advertised.<br /><br />The analog face is a little pointless in that it's extremely difficult to read compared to a true analog watch. The center dot is extremely large compared to the size of the face's hand segments. It's more of a novelty, but it does allow you to see the time in your primary time zone in all modes (including the stopwatch or timer mode) so it's useful in that respect. The Light is an orange/amber colored LED that illuminates the time from the side of the face rather than evenly throughout the entire face of the watch. It works fine, regardless.<br /><br />Need a cheap watch with plenty of features? It's not terribly slim, but it's got that great intersection of price and plenty of features that it's hard not to recommend.[EOS]

It's easy for the markers to bleed through and bleed out of the lines so I have to be careful there.  I will probably switch to colored pencils and see if that's better.<br /><br />With the boom in coloring books for adults, can we get a little bit of paper quality?

Went to Youtube for live instruction in order to install it correctly on my 2002 Tundra (also upgraded all my other original bulbs with LED bulbs from Amazon). The outcome is unbelievable. I would say it is a big difference between my old light sets and the new one. Wife and kids really love it. Now they want to drive along with me wherever the truck needed versus my brand new 2013 Lexus RX350 and Buick Enclave(both with HID headlights). I would really recommend this kit to any one. Come on no brainer with the price around $100 buck and about another $20 for all the small LED bulbs will entirely change the look of your old and undated vehicle into more modern look and more importantly much safer at night.[EOS]
[BOS]This particular bag is described as a &#34;Carry On&#34; luggage and the item description gives dimensions of 21&#34; x 14&#34; x 8.5&#34;, BUT that measurement is from its most narrow side, if you measure it from the front size and ALSO include the handle and wheels (which is what most airlines will do), then you are easily 23 inches or more.[SEP]So in short, while it's actually a nicely built luggage and the wheels are not bad, if you are looking for a carry on and don't want to risk getting charged (the airlines are way more strict now), then kindly click that my review was helpful to you, learn from my costly mistake and move on.[SEP]This particular bag is described as a &#34;Carry On&#34; luggage and the item description gives dimensions of 21&#34; x 14&#34; x 8.5&#34;, BUT that measurement is from its most narrow side, if you measure it from the front size and ALSO include the handle and wheels (which is what most airlines will do), then you are easily 23 inches or more.

So I agree with the dimensions another reviewer posted.<br /><br />I tried to get on three different airlines with this bag and it was rejected twice and I got charged more in an EXTRA bag fee ($80) than the actual cost of this bag on my International flight in Asia!  Only Southwest Airlines permitted it.

The bag is made out of nice thicker material and has a lot of space, and smaller compartments with in the actual bag. I really like how the one side is made so you can put shoes in and not get the rest of your stuff dirty! And you can fit a considerable amount of stuff in the bag for it's size!

[BOS]Given its modest price, purchased this just to determine whether it could hold camera/binoculars more securely when trekking over difficult terrain (most recently, Patagonia) than using a standard strap (a heretofore favorite being the Op/Tec version long enough to allow the camera to swing on one side).[SEP]Cannot recommend highly enough.[SEP]Given its modest price, purchased this just to determine whether it could hold camera/binoculars more securely when trekking over difficult terrain (most recently, Patagonia) than using a standard strap (a heretofore favorite being the Op/Tec version long enough to allow the camera to swing on one side). The harness won out every day and was MUCH easier on shoulders and, even with elastic straps, minimized movement and resultant need to compensate when navigating uneven ground. Speaking of elastic, my camera, a relatively heavy Nikon D300 plus 18-300 lens (the heavier version) did cause significant stretching, but adjusting the straps compensated fully and still allowed full range of motion from chest to eye level. Best of all, even after a long day, I had forgotten just how heavy the camera/lens really really was. Finally, the Op/Tech connector system allows one to mix and match various devices for ease of handling and safety.<br />Cannot recommend highly enough.[EOS]
[BOS]I have used this tool for several years now.[SEP]Mine is all dirty from mechanic work, looks like a Dalmatian (black grease spots) but it still going strong.[SEP]I have used this tool for several years now. I love this impact wrench. It is my favorite tool. It is not strong enough to brake truck lug nuts but I thats OK. That's not what this tool is for. I am a ford licenced mechanic and I use it every day for heavy mechanic work. Sometimes I have to brake the nuts and bolts with a breaker bar (like 5% of the time) but then I use this tool to take the nut or bolt out. Sometimes we mechanics encounter long bolts that would take 3 to 5+ minutes to take out with a regular ratchet. Imagine taking the transmission out from a ford explorer. It has 12 long bolts and like 18 medium bolts. Once they are all broken with the breaker bar is a matter of SECONDS to take those 12 bolts out. Normally I cut work time to a half or less using this tool. It has enough torque to help me with the 95% of the job. Deffinetely love this impact wrench. Mine is all dirty from mechanic work, looks like a Dalmatian (black grease spots) but it still going strong...[EOS]
[BOS]If you like mysteries, histories, finances and analyses, business rights and wrongs, you will really enjoy this book.[SEP]It's also a microcosm of lessons-learned like the consequences of hubris and revenue-is-not-profit,  lessons that can and should be applied to all of us in our personal lives and to 21st century business practices.[SEP]If you like mysteries, histories, finances and analyses, business rights and wrongs, you will really enjoy this book.  It is fast-paced, the author has a personal stake in this story, which is really two stories, and the author's enjoyment and enthusiasm comes through when he pieces together his well-researched clues to tell the tale of his disappearing great-uncle and the history of his great-uncle's employer, the L.R. Steel Company.  Dyer found out where and when Great Uncle Clayton disappeared and reappeared but answers to the mystery of Clayton's behavior are most likely contained within the rapid rise and fall of the L. R. Steel Company and its founder, Leonard Rambler Steel.<br /><br />For history buffs, the book is filled with photos and articles mostly from the early 1920's.  It's also a microcosm of lessons-learned like the consequences of hubris and revenue-is-not-profit,  lessons that can and should be applied to all of us in our personal lives and to 21st century business practices.[EOS]

[BOS]This tool is okay.[SEP]We also have an interchangeable screwdriver that we use all the time, so I'm certain this tool will be just as handy.[SEP]This tool is okay.  Just okay.  I feel comfortable with my younger son using it because there is no knife included in the tool.  But, it is very bulky and doesn't have a case or anything (which would make a bulkier tool easier to manage, I think).  I used the flathead screwdriver to help my son with a wooden frog punch out.  The screwdrivers aren't too sharp, but are of good size.  For the kid who's 8 or 9 who you just aren't quite ready to get a pocket knife for, I can imagine letting them handle this tool.  I'm going to let my 7 yo son use it.  It's going to stay in our utility drawer in the kitchen.  It's perfect for that.  I won't have to go all the way downstairs for several tools and it will be compact enough to not mind storing.  We also have an interchangeable screwdriver that we use all the time, so I'm certain this tool will be just as handy.[EOS]

[BOS]The ZAQ Dew Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser is a fun, modern way to eliminate the odors in your home.[SEP]This diffuser would make a lovely gift.[SEP]The ZAQ Dew Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser is a fun, modern way to eliminate the odors in your home.  The simple sleek design is very eye catching and setup took only a few minutes.  Pull the diffuser out of the box, fill with water from the measuring cup provided, add 3-4 drops of scented oils (not provided), plug it in, push the button, and presto! --  your house is smelling fantastic!  I had a few friends over right after I got the diffuser and they loved the fact that it changed colors and were instantly intrigued by the design. The device has an auto shutoff (when it runs out of water) as well and you can also adjust it so that it will scent but not have the light. The only thing I do warn about is that unless you are trying to do a quick coverup of your stinky kitchen, perhaps only use 2 drops of oil and be sure to put the machine away from any food.  The first few times I ran the diffuser I set it on the kitchen table and, while eating a quick snack, I found myself being a bit overwhelmed by the scent. After moving it to a different spot and adding a little less oil, I find that it works much better.<br /><br />I love scented products and have used many different types for creating that ambiance and atmosphere throughout my home. This one adds moisture to dry air as well, which is especially great during the winter months. This diffuser would make a lovely gift.[EOS]

[BOS]LOTS of power.[SEP]Very much worth the money.[SEP]LOTS of power. So much power. My husband charged his android phone to 75% (because he then had to use the thing), I charged my iPhone 5S multiple times, and we're still on the first charging. It managed to charge overnight. I had my iPhone going at full tilt (Waze was running, as well as YouTube, and LTE turned on) on my trip on the bus. I was teetering on 20% battery life. In an hour, while using my phone with all the things running, I managed to get back up to 75% battery while plugged into the 2 amp side. The battery amount left over display is really helpful, because those freaking dots that other battery backups have don't tell you anything.<br /><br />We own a [[ASIN:B003ZBZ64Q External Battery, New Trent iCarrier 12000mAh Portable Dual USB Port External Battery Charger/Power Pack for Smartphones, iPhone 6, Iphone 6 Plus, S5, Nexus 6, Note 4, Tablets, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, and more (Now w/Micro-USB charge port)]] that I've had for a couple of years now. Look at the price on that thing, and compare it to the price for the TSST one. It's night and day, isn't it? The amount of mAh on this one isn't that far behind the NewTrent one, but this one costs like half of the other one. Might as well buy two of these if you need that much battery charge.<br /><br />It is heavy though (like a pound or so), so if you're one of those people who hates carrying extra weight, then you'll be stuck with a lower capacity battery, because the amount of charging you get out of this sucker is very good. You can't have it all, can you? Either you sacrifice the amount of charge you get, or sacrifice having a heavy little brick in your bag.<br /><br />This is thicker and slightly larger than my iPhone, but it's small enough to fit into a regular sized handbag or backpack. It does fit into my pocket for those times that I want to talk on the phone while having the phone charge, and walk around (you'd be surprised how frequent that occurrence happens). When I do so in my pyjamas, it will bang against my leg, so I make sure to just slide the battery thingy into the pocket of my hoodie or something.<br /><br />For what you're paying for the unit, this is a very slick little device. It's got sensible features that you will find yourself wishing in all your other devices. It's also pretty enough that other people comment on it. Very much worth the money.[EOS]

You don't have to look too closely to see exactly why Elvis and Michael Jackson ended up the way they did.

[BOS]Found this on sale, and being a sucker for deals, I decided to give it a go.[SEP]Review by M. Reynard 2013[SEP]Found this on sale, and being a sucker for deals, I decided to give it a go.  After all, it's natural, and some organic ingredients, and is certified for no parabens.  Not a bad deal.<br /><br />I liked the smell.  It actually smelled a bit like baby powder to me.  Sweet and fresh and powdery.  Maybe not what someone is expecting from the tag of "Hawaiian" and to be quite honest, I don't know what a kukui is (one web search later, a Kukui is a type of Hawaiian tree).  Still, I don't know what one smells like, so I can only assume that this perhaps smells like it.  The wash itself lathers into a nice white foam.  I wouldn't say it's an extreme amount of foam.  Indeed, it did better on a poof while it pretty much failed the bath bubble test, but a small amount was enough to lather a full body.  I think I used about a quarter sized amount each time with no problem.<br /><br />I commented a bit on ingredients already.  Most are pretty good.  There is sodium laureth sulfate, which I was slightly disappointed with.  But there's also Kukui extract and shea butter.  And the overall ingredient list wasn't huge. Still, I think it could be a little better, but at least it seems fairly easy on the skin.  It's also moisturizing, which I can agree with as skin seems softer after using it.  And it does a normal cleaning job with skin as most other shower gels.<br /><br />I liked this shower gel, but I'd opt for one with a little better ingredient list should I choose again.  But for the price, especially on a 16oz bottle, it's not bad.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2013[EOS]

[BOS]Here's the reason why I'm giving it five stars even though it didn't fit - it came in quickly, and I should've read more of the reviews to understand how the sizing would work, considering it's still a great product.[SEP]It gave my butt a great lift, however, if I were to try to wear the medium even though it was too small, I'd have to readjust it every second[SEP]Here's the reason why I'm giving it five stars even though it didn't fit - it came in quickly, and I should've read more of the reviews to understand how the sizing would work, considering it's still a great product. I'm 130lbs and 5'9, so I am very slim, but even a medium was too small. For any of you that are my size but already have a booty to begin with, I'd recommend getting an xtra large. It looks like you have butt pads on when you get it too small! So just be extra careful. It gave my butt a great lift, however, if I were to try to wear the medium even though it was too small, I'd have to readjust it every second[EOS]
[BOS]I was originally hoping to find a really nice steel or aluminum muddler, but wasn't able to find something that seemed to be well designed — they'd look gorgeous, but reviews would frequently mention difficulty cleaning them or a lack of longevity.[SEP]While this won't influence your cocktail, it isn't something you want to leave out with any nicer cocktail accessories.[SEP]I was originally hoping to find a really nice steel or aluminum muddler, but wasn't able to find something that seemed to be well designed — they'd look gorgeous, but reviews would frequently mention difficulty cleaning them or a lack of longevity. That's when I decided I'd just get something that would get the job done inexpensively, and found this muddler. I don't think I'll be looking at muddlers again for a long while.<br /><br />Several other reviews here mention the packaging on this item to be particularly heinous, and I'm delighted to report that it has been improved substantially if my shipment is any indication. There was an adequate and reasonable amount of plastic (not cling/saran style) wrapped around the muddler that was removed easily, and the sticker attached directly to the muddler was using a very amiable adhesive that didn't leave any detectable residue.<br /><br />The weight of the muddler is fantastic, despite concerns that it would be too lightweight. The end used for muddling is quite sharp and won't be letting cherries or other fruit slip around much, but it isn't my favorite for more delicate ingredients like mint sprigs. In terms of appearance, the color isn't consistent, nor is the glossiness. While this won't influence your cocktail, it isn't something you want to leave out with any nicer cocktail accessories.[EOS]

[BOS]A very impressive little unit.[SEP]Thanks[SEP]A very impressive little unit.Bought it for my sons birthday so he could play video games with his friends in the basement. Long story short...TV is in the basement and the projector is upstairs now. I really was impressed with the picture quality and the 3D capability. Hilariously, I bought this to save some money rather than buying a new big TV but after playing with it for a while I feel this is really the next wave of home entertainment. I will be buying another one when the time comes. Thanks[EOS]
[BOS]This is a very simple to use product.[SEP]I would not recommend either the product or the seller.[SEP]This is a very simple to use product. You plug in the base unit to an outlet and your phone line. Then plug the remote unit into an outlet and attach your fax machine to it. The two should automatically connect to each other. If they don't the manufacturer recommends pressing a button on the side to force them to connect to each other. When I initially purchased this product it worked but after eight months it has stopped working. I have tried all of the recommended ideas such as using a different outlet, not using a power strip, making sure they aren't too far apart etc. Once they stopped working I read some of the reviews on Amazon and discovered this product has failed for many people after a short period of time. I contacted the seller, FamilySafe, and they initially offered 30% off the purchase price. Unacceptable since it had completely failed and needed to be replaced within the first year of use. I re-contacted them and they flatly refused to assist me. I would not recommend either the product or the seller.[EOS]

[BOS]One of the higher quality open top double mag pouch for M1A/M14 20 rd magazines.[SEP]Attaching pouches to a MOLLE vest would be ideal.[SEP]One of the higher quality open top double mag pouch for M1A/M14 20 rd magazines. Used CMI mags to test; nice & snug but not super tight. The elastic retainer cords required a initial stretch to get them to fit the mags. Cord is knotted, so it can be adjusted. MOLLE attachment straps that had no problem fitting a 1-3/4&#34; pistol belt. The quality is there; expected something less, but found that Condor does make some fine gear. I'm not a fan of open top pouches for M1A due to exposing mags to the environment, but this one will do for urban applications/quick react. Weight of 2 mags plus a pistol loaded on a belt is about max without suspenders. Attaching pouches to a MOLLE vest would be ideal.[EOS]

[BOS]I confess.[SEP]I love it.[SEP]I confess...if I had to pick a favorite part of a home project, it would have to be demo.  There's just something...satisfying about knocking down something that's bugged you enough to want to renovate it.  It speaks to that prehistoric reptilian portion of our brains.<br /><br />This is a very good tool, not just for general demo but for uses where a crowbar would be too big.  First check:  it's heavy and sturdy, which is something that a good breaker bar/demo tool should be.  It's solid and substantial.<br /><br />Second check: it has a good handle.  The handle is important, not just for giving you a good grip, but for absorbing vibrations when you go to town on something.  Indeed, the head has a nice flat spot that doubles as a, ahem, &#34;percussive tool&#34; to slam the heck out of things.  And it works.<br /><br />Third check: it's versatile.  By that I mean it has an adjustable head.  This means if you need to pry something at an odd angle, you can adjust the head and get a 90 degree angle from the handle and whatever you're prying.  This makes life a LOT easier.<br /><br />In sum, this is the archetypal demo tool, easy to use and built to last.  I love it.[EOS]

[BOS]Warning to all that buy this![SEP]If you were in charge of making a knock off like this, wouldn't you do that and also test it so folks don't go out and waste their money on junk?[SEP]Warning to all that buy this!!!!!!!:  The pleated seal on a scale of 1 to 10 in stiffness (where 10 is the stiffest) is a 10.  The original Kreepy Krauly seal is a 1.  What happens the sweeper will no longer negotiate the curves of the pool and it goes to one end and gets stuck.  Then you free it up and it goes to its favorite spot at the other end of the pool and gets stuck.  My pool was like I had no sweeper anymore.<br /><br />I just replaced it with the expensive OEM part made by Kreepy Krauly and it is amazing the difference.<br /><br />So if someone is going to bother manufacturing an aftermarket part like this, why not make it have the same properties so it works right?  If you were in charge of making a knock off like this, wouldn't you do that and also test it so folks don't go out and waste their money on junk?????[EOS]

[BOS]They taste good.[SEP]I just wish I could have more confidence in their manufacturing.[SEP]They taste good. But I'm not so sure about their quality control.<br /><br />In the photo I've uploaded, you can see the size variation between some of the gummies. The larger one is the standard size, but there were quite a few like the stumpy one. I didn't count them, but the product is sold by units rather than weight, so presumably I got less. Not such a big deal I guess, but when you consider that we're only really going by their word as to what's inside the gummies, the lack of quality control on the size doesn't exactly fill me with confidence that the right amount of vitamins and minerals is going into the product.<br /><br />I've noticed issues with their other products too, where this is quite a variation between packages of the same product - some where the gummy is softer, others where it is harder. Some where there is a lot of sugar dusted on them, some where there is very little and they all stick together in a big glob.<br /><br />That said, I continue to buy them because they taste good, they're easy to take, and it's better than nothing. I just wish I could have more confidence in their manufacturing.[EOS]

[BOS](This is for the Double Choco Espresso variety.[SEP]For similar calorie count with less fat and about half the price of these, I suggest giving those a try if you're looking for an easily packed snack.[SEP](This is for the Double Choco Espresso variety.)<br /><br />Years ago, I bought and really enjoyed the [[ASIN:B000R9RYUI Honest Foods Country Squares Farmer's Trail Mix]] squares.  I'd read some reviews that the bars were smaller, more expensive, and not as good now that Earnest took over, but I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />Maybe I went with the wrong variety, but the Double Choco Espresso squares that I received are really dry.  Not crunchy and stale, mind you, but "moist" isn't a word that would even remotely enter your mind upon taking a bite, unless is was prefaced by "wow, these sure aren't."  It's like being in a real life "Got Milk" commercial.  The flavor is okay (not great, but okay), but the dryness is really off putting, and they are quite small.<br /><br />Given the current price of over $1/bar for these (and over $1.50 for some of them), I'd recommend passing.  For a while now, I've been eating [[ASIN:B006BHRV1W Nature's Bakery Whole Wheat Fig Bars]] (I've tried and liked the fig and raspberry flavors).  For similar calorie count with less fat and about half the price of these, I suggest giving those a try if you're looking for an easily packed snack.[EOS]

[BOS]First of all, this is a beautiful guitar![SEP]Amazon has an easy return policy, so it would even be worth sending one back to get the next one right, if necessary.[SEP]First of all, this is a beautiful guitar!  Great finish, beautiful wood, well made.  It's got very good tone, and plays easy right out of the box.  I also have a Gibson J-45, so I've got something to compare it to.  No, it doesn't sound as good as the Gibson, but for around $350, I wasn't expecting it to.  I bought this guitar because I wanted something different from my dreadnaught, and to have something that I didn't have to humidify.  I had one problem.  There was a buzz on the top string at the 12th fret.  Fortunately for me, I have a friend who is a luthier, and after some work to the frets, it sounds great!  Also I wasn't a fan of the stock strings, so I changed them out for my favorites (Elixir nano-webs), and found it playing better after that as well.  In short, beautiful guitar, especially for the money, very good tone, but may need some work to get it right.  Amazon has an easy return policy, so it would even be worth sending one back to get the next one right, if necessary.[EOS]

[BOS]This display case is fairly attractive, but the quality of the workmanship isn't quite what I was hoping for, especially for the price I paid.[SEP]But, the manufacturer of the frame could have created a better product with a little more effort.[SEP]This display case is fairly attractive, but the quality of the workmanship isn't quite what I was hoping for, especially for the price I paid. The finish on the wood isn't completely even, and there is a small place on the front of the frame that shows where someone used a different shade of paint to cover up a flaw. Very disappointing. Also, it does not close tightly. The glass cover will shut, but it does not close air-tight. In fact, if the flag is not folded flat enough, the cover tends to pop open. I like the brass plate, and the engraving looks nice. In spite of the flaws, I decided to keep this because it had already been personalized and I wasn't sure a replacement would come out any better. The company who sells this was very professional and wrote me a nice email, thanking me for my purchase. I appreciate their conscientious customer service. But, the manufacturer of the frame could have created a better product with a little more effort.[EOS]

[BOS]Bought this for my 5 year old who is playing t-ball for the first time.[SEP]Great value product.[SEP]Bought this for my 5 year old who is playing t-ball for the first time.  It fits my 7 year old as well, and may fit him when he's 8.  He's an average size kid.  The entire outfit when worn is a little heavy, but I think it's the nature of catcher's gear.  The weight won't prevent them for running around in it.  Extremely durable.  I can't imagine anything breaking on it.  The helmet seems to allow for a small or large head.  I don't think you would find something better for the money.  Great value product.[EOS]

[BOS]This was my first time using Chemical Guys products and I was pleasantly surprised.[SEP]It became unusable within 6 months.[SEP]This was my first time using Chemical Guys products and I was pleasantly surprised. The cleaners work well and leave your car nice and squeaky clean. The citrus cleaner is the best cleaner, good for washing the car the day you plan to wax it. The gloss-works is best for cleaning a lightly soiled car, but does leave it wetter looking than the other washes. The big jug which I guess is a mix of the two runs right down the middle on cleaning power and gloss. The gloves are of good quality, particularly the microfiber glove. Those tend to fall apart or mold quickly here in Florida, but this one is still going strong.<br /><br />But the foam sprayer is of poor quality.<br />When this thing worked, it was great and I plan to buy another one, but will seek out a different brand. When I first got it, there was a missing part on the foamer (the hose/strainer that sucks up the soap). I called chemical guys directly to see if they would send me a replacement. They were very friendly and sent me one at no cost that arrived in only a few days. I was pretty impressed since I had actually purchased this through a third party vendor. The foamer worked like a champ for the first couple of months, but started leaking shortly after that. Then, the trigger started sticking so you couldn't stop the flow of foam. It became unusable within 6 months.[EOS]

[BOS]This watch has a lot of nice features.[SEP]Overall, I think this is a nice watch with a good set of features.[SEP]This watch has a lot of nice features.  The date is displayed on a white background, smoothly tucked between the 4 and 5 o'clock hour markers.  The watch hacks when setting allowing you to precisely set the seconds.  The chronograph seconds hand smoothly sweeps at 5 ticks per second.  The lume is bright and easy to read in the dark.<br /><br />Light blue accents on the chrono second hand and on the chapter ring at 12, 3, 6, and 9 add a pleasant dash of color.  The lume applied to the hour markers also has a slight blue tinge.  The only criticism of the watch face is that the markers on the running seconds do not match precisely with each tick of the second hand.<br /><br />The weakest part of the watch is the bracelet.  The bracelet makes a jangly sound when you move your wrist due to the hollow end links.  The clasp is of good quality and clicks securely closed.  The bracelet does not have half-links, but the clasp has two micro-adjust settings allowing you to fine tune the fit of the bracelet.  I replaced the bracelet with an after-market leather strap.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice watch with a good set of features.[EOS]

I only have a couple complaints about the seat and they're not major issues.  Now that I am pregnant, I will likely buy the same seat for my own child.  P.S. my nephew is now in the chicco next fit and I absolutely love it!<br /><br />Pros-<br />Operation..all around.  The way it latches and unlatches from the base is easy.  The way the belts tighten and loosen to fit baby is great.  The operation of the handle is also much easier to fold back than some I have seen.<br /><br />Installation was so easy.<br /><br />The material feels durable without being stiff.<br /><br />Cons-<br />The canopy doesn't cover much at all.<br />The seat is quite heavy, but most are heavier than they should be in my opinion.<br />The seat (when in the base) takes up quite a bit of space in my car (2013 Acura RDX).  It wouldn't fit behind the driver as the next fit now will.[EOS]

[BOS]My son and I are mosquito magnets.[SEP]I am planning on planting some yarrow in my garden for next year.[SEP]My son and I are mosquito magnets.  We live in the DFW area....not sure if that matters, but I haven't been bit even once while wearing this stuff.  We ran out and I ran to CVS and bought a bottle of OFF that does not contain DEET...some other chemical that has a multitude of warnings on it...and I was swarmed the instant I went outside.  I am going back to Skeeter Screen.<br /><br />On another note...for those bothered by mosquitoes...they do not like yarrow.  I don't know how they react to the ornamental type, but I know they stay away from the wild stuff.  I lived in a tent in Colorado for two years and with the spring thaw...mosquitoes in swarms too big to believe would be on the hunt.  I remember reading about yarrow of which there was plenty growing wild up there and started picking the flower heads and putting them in my button holes.  The swarm would follow in a cloud a couple feet from my head, but wouldn't come closer.  They never bit.  It isn't smelly stuff so I am not sure why they avoid it, but they do.  I am planning on planting some yarrow in my garden for next year.[EOS]

[BOS]I was surprised to see that the non-stick coated plates are supposedly dishwasher safe.[SEP]Both the hot sandwiches and the waffles leaked gunk under the plates, making an awful mess to clean up.[SEP]I was surprised to see that the non-stick coated plates are supposedly dishwasher safe. I love things that can go in the dishwasher so the first thing I did was run all the plates through the dw. When my husband emptied the dw it looked like soap has stuck and crusted all over the plates, so he left them in and ran them again. I was the next to empty the dw and when I opened it the plates looked like soft pretzels covered with salt. I took them out to wash off what I thought was soap by hand and it wasn't soap, it was some weird metal oxidation all over the non-stick side of every plate. I had to scrub it off, and it wouldn't all come off, and it left marks behind.<br /><br />When the plates were dry we used it to make hot sandwiches once and to make waffles once. We have a [[ASIN:B00006F2MD Cuisinart Dual-Sandwich Nonstick Electric Grill]] which I am not thrilled with, but this Black and Decker makes it look good by comparison.

[BOS]What a neat mini video camera.[SEP]This will definitely come in handy![SEP]What a neat mini video camera. It was an easy set up. I charged the device for 8 hours and afterwards I glanced over the first few paragraphs of the updated user instructions. This item does not require batteries. It has an internal battery. I purchased a MICRO SDHC memory card for storage as needed and a 8 GB was only twelve dollars at Walgreens. It was so simple: Charge device using the charger provided and insert the memory card and press the on button.  You also have a choice of three video recording modes. When the video camera is working correctly you will see a blinking green light.  Don't be surprised if you are already recording while learning to use the camera. This happened to me. Next I wanted to figure out how to play back a video. Wow it took me under five minutes to figure out how. First plug the video camera into your computer by using the USB cord provided. Now go to the start menu and click on Your Computer. Look for the correct drive where your camera is located. Now if you are in the right place it will have a file that opens and says DVR. Doubled click on the DVR and you will see instant video with playback options. I couldn't believe how beautifully clear the picture was! The Megapixels in HD are awesome in the video recordings. I am impressed. The size is very compact. This will definitely come in handy![EOS]

[BOS]I am a researcher.[SEP]You might think I'm babying mine, or maybe that's why I didn't have excessive vibration when I use it, but I'll put the beef bones in the trash and grind up the rest of the stuff with this and be just fine for many years to come, I hope![SEP]I am a researcher.  I read every review - the good and the bad.  I've read the Consumer Reports reviews, read the Amazon reviews, read the other, sketchier review websites like GreatGarbageDisposals.com (I made that one up but if you've done any research on the internet you get my point).  I am writing this review to share what I learned about the product and about the many reviews I've read.  My situation was that our 6 year old Badger froze up and simply quit on me, so a new one was in order.<br /><br />First, is it loud or quiet?  It really depends on which review you read, apparently.  I believe it depends on more than that, such as what kind of sink is it being installed under - a stainless steel or a porcelain coated cast iron sink?  One is very thin and flexible and will not block out as much noise or damp vibrations as effectively as a heavy cast iron sink.  I have found the overall noise level to be a lot like the Badger 5 that I replaced.  My wife thinks it sounds a bit different but neither louder nor quieter. It also depends on whether this is your first disposer (it is certainly louder than not having one) or a replacement.  Bottom line, it's typically run for a few seconds, with the water running too, as you are cleaning up after meal (not in the middle of the night when everyone's trying to sleep) and it's no louder or quieter than the rest. I wouldn't let that be a deciding factor unless you have different criteria.  If so, you can pay twice as much for that other &#34;Elite&#34; one by another manufacturer that is CR-rated as the quietest one.  In my case I couldn't justify the added cost.<br /><br />What's up with that scary loud noise when you turn it on?  There are some reviews that make this sound like it is eating a spoon (a LOUD, disturbing, and/or startling snap or click noise, etc.).  I have to say that was one of my biggest reservations when I ordered this thing, having read the reviews.  A fairly large slice of reviewers commented negatively on it.  Here's my take...  The motor is 3/4 HP compared to my little dinky 1/3 HP motor on my old one.  That is a lot more horsepower and, consequently, a lot more torque.  The little &#34;teeth&#34; that do the waste grinding that sit in the base of the chamber spin freely.  When you turn it on, the little grinders snap into place like how your head gets whipped back on one of those crazy spinning carnival rides. It's just from centrifugal force setting the blades into place.  The fine print in the directions tell you that it is part of the anti-jam mechanism.  It's not startling or even disconcerting to me or my wife.  We didn't blink an eye. I couldn't scare my children by turning it on.  It just makes a bit of a click when you turn it on. No biggie.  Full disclosure here - ours is mounted to the bottom of a heavy, porcelain coated cast iron sink.  Our sink may be better at handling the torque and may dampen the sound and vibration more than a thin stainless steel sink.  Our sink weighs probably 75 pounds.  A stainless steel sink weighs 7 pounds.  A heavier sink can probably handle a garbage disposal operating under full load better than a flexible, lightweight sink.  That's not why we got the sink but I think it's probably a benefit to damping sounds and vibrations.<br /><br />Some folks knocked the instructions.  Take heart.  It appears that the Waste King guys have heard the criticisms from the negative reviewers.  I am guessing that they have been re-written to better explain the installation because they are really easy to follow.  My best advice is this: don't be afraid of a difficult or confounding set of installation instructions.  It is really easy.  Here's what you do. Go to youtube.com and search for a video on How To Remove Your Existing Garbage Disposal because this is the hardest part.  You will find one that matches yours.  Watch it.  I started removing the Badger incorrectly, stopped, watched a video, and then it was a piece of cake.  In my case, I shouldn't have removed the three long screws before removing the body of the old one. You do it after it is disconnected.  READ the instruction manual carefully.  Then go ahead and youtube the Waste King installation video.  It is very easy once you see it done.  No filing or grinding gaskets, and Good Lord, no car jacks under your sink please.  If it is hard then you are doing something wrong. STOP!!! Review the procedure. Start again. The directions are actually very explicit.  The parts are well labeled. The diagrams show you what to do. The videos show you what to do.  If you prepare yourself (15 minutes of reading and watching videos, tops) you will fly though the installation and be a happy person.<br /><br />Regarding the comments that the EZ Mount is flimsy or cheap or plastic, I have to respectfully disagree.  The purpose of the lock ring is to compress the rubber gasket tight enough to make a seal so the thing doesn't leak.  It doesn't need to be made from titanium or cast iron.  Just because it isn't made from a rare earth metal doesn't make it inferior!  It keeps the price down and works (so far) flawlessly.  I did not need to tap the ears with a small hammer to get it to slide to the fully locked position - I was able to twist it into place with my bare non-Superman hands.  I did not need to put dish soap on the ear slots but the directions suggest doing that if it is difficult to put into locked position.<br /><br />Removing ALL the old mounting hardware, cleaning everything really good, and installing the EZ Mount was truly a very easy and thoroughly explained process.  No leaks at all on my first attempt!<br /><br />As advertised, it does come with a corded plug so it will need an outlet.  My old Badger was a direct wire.  Some folks tore out the cord and the strain relief as a fix and hard wired it like their old one.  Some folks put an outlet in, which I found that to be a 15 minute job.  I didn't want to mess around with chopping out the stock cord and putting in a new one and messing with the strain relief replacement.  I thought the new outlet process was much easier because, heck, the wire's already there and that's always the hardest part of wiring a box!  I shoved some of the extra length of the existing wire back into the hole in the wall that it came out from. I thought carefully about where the new box should go so the body of the disposal didn't hit it.  I screwed it to the back of the cabinet, poked the wires into the box, screwed them to a new receptacle and, voila!. NOTE: IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS YOURSELF.  If you do, be sure to kill the power at the circuit breaker and it is probably the easiest box you will install.  Just make sure it is securely mounted into something besides the flimsy back panel of the cabinet.<br /><br />I think those are all the important items I wanted to share.  The removal of the old one, cleaning the sink hole, and putting in the new box took about 35 minutes start to finish.  I wasn't rushing but I was well prepared and had everything ready to go.  Plumbers Putty was needed for install.  Make sure you have that on hand.  There was a thin rubber gasket that went under the flange (between the top flange and a stainless steel sink) that I didn't use because I didn't have a stainless steel sink.  The one tricky thing I recall from the directions is that the same procedure is repeated twice in a couple of places - one for using the existing Badger mounting hardware and one for if you are using the EZ Mount system.  If you are using the EZ Mount, make sure to SKIP the paragraph that is describing the work as it applies to the Badger mount.  That's about it.  I had to cut 3/4&#34; off the black waste discharge pipe (90 degree elbow piece that screws into the new disposal) so that everything fit with my old plumbing.  I loosened up all the slip joints on the old plumbing so I could wiggle things around as needed, aligned everything, and tightened the plumbing back up.  New install was completed in well under 20 minutes after the removal and outlet installation.<br /><br />I hope this helps some folks who were undecided about this product.  How can you ignore a 10 year warranty on something that is well below the price of competing models?  No regrets here - we've had it almost a month now and use it daily.  We can FINALLY grind those lemon and lime wedges!!!<br /><br />One last thought - Beef bones?  I see that Consumer Reports tests these things by measuring the fineness of the grind using beef bones.  Do people really put beef bones down a garbage disposal on purpose?  You might think I'm babying mine, or maybe that's why I didn't have excessive vibration when I use it, but I'll put the beef bones in the trash and grind up the rest of the stuff with this and be just fine for many years to come, I hope![EOS]

[BOS]Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class.[SEP]amazon.com/gp/product/B00R3E3FB2[SEP]Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. My friend has one one of these babies and I've gotta say, you haven't seen anything until you've seen that TV http://fave.co/1cwJN0j  Anyway, this TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.  One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage.  Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.  The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:  As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.  This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.  Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of this TV:  With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.  Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have. Pick yourself up a cheaper refurbished but still fully functioning TV! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R3E3FB2[EOS]

[BOS]It's the simplicity that makes this thermostat so great.[SEP]It takes some care to not slide the switch too far into a non-working position.[SEP]It's the simplicity that makes this thermostat so great.  You don't have to program it, you don't have to teach it your habits, you don't have to debug it after a power outage, and you don't have to fight it when you want change.  You just push the button for what you want.<br /><br />The thermostat uses standard wire connection codes so swapping it in is effortless - wire it the same way the previous one was wired.  Activation thresholds, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature can be reprogramed to match your home system if needed.  The default thresholds work fine for me.  I lowered the maximum temperature so my house won't cook if the &#34;up&#34; button gets stuck.<br /><br />What would make this perfect would be different cover plates for the mode slider switch to represent different hookups.  I have a two stage heater so &#34;off&#34; and &#34;heat&#34; are in the middle two slots of a four position switch.  It takes some care to not slide the switch too far into a non-working position.[EOS]

[BOS](Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products.[SEP]Just look at the rankings of best headphones at innerfidelity.com in its &#34;Wall of Fame&#34; section, and you'll find the best headphones in every price range currently on themarket (except for products that are too cheap to even be able to compete at all).[SEP](Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. We only agree to these requests when it's something we would actually use. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, we always begin with a disclaimer.)<br /><br />When the seller first contacted me with an invitation to review one of their cheaper headphones, I told the person that I'm very picky about audio products, since I'm an audio professional, and really cheap consumer audio products will very likely just get a low rating from me, due to how poor the sound quality is and the subpar design and construction (and my general advice is, if you can afford something better, don't settle for really bad sound quality). The person then asked me to review this Soundpeasts A1 headphone instead, which I assume, is their higher end product.<br /><br />The headphone is fairly comfortable, and the rotating earcups can flatten out for easier storage/portability. But the cloth bag that comes with the headphone is badly designed, since it's only deep enough if you have the headband on its shortest setting, and if you have a bigger head and need to pull the headband extender out longer, the headphone will stick out of the bag and the drawstring cannot be pulled to tighten the bag to close all the way. The cloth used is also very cheap and thin, and will in fact let a lot the finer grains of dust in through the material.<br /><br />The matte surface coating of the paint is problematic, because it's very easy to mar it if you accidentally rub on it with something hard (such as your fingernail). I had just taken it out of the box when I noticed the surface of one of the earcups is already marred (maybe it rubbed against the packaging while being taken out?).<br /><br />The pairing process was straightforward and worked on first try. This isn't the case with some bluetooth products, so good job there.<br /><br />The user's manual has a glaring problem. It states that you both receive and reject a phone call by pushing the power button. HUH? How the hell is that logical? The translation is also subpar, as if the translator has never once read an English user's manual before for similar products. It refers to blinking LED light as &#34;glittering,&#34; It also refers to bluetooth pairing mode as &#34;matching procedure.&#34;<br /><br />As for the sound quality, it's not bad. The most important thing any audio devices needs to get right, is to first do no harm--meaning it should not cause the listener physical pain. So many consumer audio products break that rule and have excessively bright/shrill sound, thus causing piercing pain to the ears when listening even at moderate volume. This headphone is slightly bright, but not nearly as bad as many cheap audio products (yes, $36 is considered very cheap in the world of serious headphones, since really good ones usually cost several hundred to well over thousands of dollars for truly high-end reference quality headphones). On some material that's mastered a bit bright, it can be fatiguing in some spots with the sibilance, but at lower volumes it's not too bad. The lower frequencies are rolled off in the sub-bass region, so there's no authoritative presence below 70 Hz or so. But it's a gentle roll-off so you still get some response down to 30Hz--it's just relatively weak.<br /><br />Overall, this is decent sounding for the price, and if you can't hear the deficiencies I pointed out, then you can be perfectly happy with these. But if you are in any way a discerning audiophile or can hear the problems I mentioned, I would advise you to spend more on something that sounds more accurate/neutral.

[BOS]I am a long time fan of Sony NEX cameras, and I have owned and used many of the Sony brand E-mount lenses available for the NEX cameras, including the Sony SEL16F28 16mm f/2.8 Wide-Angle, the SEL1855 E-mount 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 OSS, and the SEL55210 55-210mm f/4.5-6.3.[SEP]RECOMMENDED.[SEP]I am a long time fan of Sony NEX cameras, and I have owned and used many of the Sony brand E-mount lenses available for the NEX cameras, including the Sony SEL16F28 16mm f/2.8 Wide-Angle, the SEL1855 E-mount 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 OSS, and the SEL55210 55-210mm f/4.5-6.3. All those lenses have produced great pictures, especially when using RAW output corrected for distortion and chromatic aberrations through software such as Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom. When using the JPG mode the more recent NEX cameras, such as the NEX-5N and NEX-7, will, if the firmware has been updated, make a lot of those same corrections internally and automatically apply the corrections to the saved JPG images.<br /><br />The only draw back to the zoom lenses of course is that they are slow. Still, for low light level work, the use of a so-so slow lens with vibration stabilization will usually beat an optically  much better fast lens that does not support stabilization. So I was interested to try the Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8 for low light work. The extra lens speed allows for the use of a lower ISO, and the net gain in image qaulity is worth the cost to use of a fast lens.<br /><br />The lens has been great for work in low light, and the focal length has been perfect for close-ups of architectural details and art objects. If a photographer shoots in RAW, and uses Adobe Camera RAW or Lightroom to correct for lens distortions via software lens profiles, and to correct for chromatic aberration, or if the photographer shoots in JPG and uses the NEX camera's internal software corrections, then the few weak points of the lens are effectively canceled out. I have been very happy with my Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8, and plan to use it often on my next project. RECOMMENDED.[EOS]

[BOS]The Raspberry Pi is basically a small computer that will just about fit into an Altoids tin.[SEP]Buy one, you'll find a good use for it![SEP]The Raspberry Pi is basically a small computer that will just about fit into an Altoids tin.  It's powered by a cell phone charger and uses a SD card for its hard drive.  It has USB so you can plug in more storage, a keyboard, wifi dongle or more.  It has HDMI out, which will carry both audio and video as well as a normal audio headphone jack.  It has an Ethernet port so you can get it on the Internet and connected to your home network.  At the price point, it just can't be beat!<br /><br />I have one of my Raspberry Pi machines set up as a music server.  With a free iPhone app I can remotely connect to my Pi and stream music to my phone or to any Internet connected machine.  It is the gold standard for me, as I've always wanted a way to access all of my music on the go and this device pulls it off nicely.  It has enough power to read a FLAC file and convert it to a nice streamable MP3 on the fly, something that really impressed me.<br /><br />The Pi can also act as a very basic machine for those who just want something to surf the Internet.  It can be set up to stream videos over your network, but 720P seems to be the max here as 1080P video takes just a bit too much processing power.  While I haven't used it for this purpose yet, the Pi seems to be the new CPU of choice for people building retro arcade cabinets as the Pi seems to do a great job handing arcade game ROMs.<br /><br />The bottom line is the Raspberry Pi is a fun toy to play with and a valuable learning tool if you want to get under the hood and more involved with things like the Linux operating system.  It's low power enough to run it all the time and use it as a server and it's powerful enough to play Hi-Def 720P videos.  Buy one, you'll find a good use for it![EOS]

[BOS]2 Guns was a fun movie that I am certain to watch again.[SEP]4 stars - MR[SEP]2 Guns was a fun movie that I am certain to watch again.  It is a gritty CIA/DEA/Mil-Intel/Crime Thriller based around bank robbery money, drugs, and a Mexican drug lord.  While I find it silly that men can get shot in one scene and fight and stuff in the next, this was based on a comic book story, which I am sure had "superhero-ish" characters.  The comic aspect does not come through in the movie though, which was good. I recommend this one to ALL cop and military action/thriller fans. Great acting carries a "comic book" plot that has more twists than a roller coaster! 4 stars - MR[EOS]

[BOS]The knife has potential but I'm surprised Smith and Wesson allows their name to be associated with this Chinese made toy.[SEP]No matter how inexpensive something is the basic safety feature must be tested and work before it is allowed to leave the factory.[SEP]The knife has potential but I'm surprised Smith and Wesson allows their name to be associated with this Chinese made toy. The internal locking frame does not engage thereby making the knife less than safe. It is nice and light and the edge only needs to be touched up slightly to make it sharp enough to be serviceable. I attempted to take the thing apart to grind down the locking device to make it work but I don't have enough small torx bits that fit to get the job done. I purchased the knife to give to a young nephew but cannot knowingly give something that may cause a severe accident to anyone. I will keep the knife to use around the work shop, I grew up with non-lock-blade knives but things like this are unacceptable. No matter how inexpensive something is the basic safety feature must be tested and work before it is allowed to leave the factory.[EOS]

[BOS]bought this after my Philips QT4050 broke from fall down a flight of stairs.[SEP]It does the job, but there are trimmer that do just as good of a job at a lot cheaper price.[SEP]bought this after my Philips QT4050 broke from fall down a flight of stairs.  I found this on sale at Future Shop and decided to get this over the another 4050.<br /><br />I would rate this 2.5 out of 5, but Amazon doesn't allow that, and I think it is closure to a 3 then a 2.  For every positive this razor has a negative.<br /><br />As far as the charging stand goes, if you are someone that likes to keep things on top of your counter this is possibly the nicest looking trimmer and stand on the market.  I personally don't, after it's finished charging I place it in the drawer, but if looks are important, this trimmer gets a 5 in the department.<br /><br />The charging stand does have a negative.  The light on the stand only indicates that charger is actually on the stand correctly.  The light on the stand will either be on, meaning the trimmer is on the stand, or the light will be off.  The light is only red, it will not change colors when it is done charging, nor will it turn off.<br /><br />When fully charged this has an incredible battery life, however the trimmer does not have any indicator to let you know when the battery is dying or how much life you have left.  This is a huge negative, since this trimmer can only be used as a cordless.  There is no option to use a cord, the trimmer can only be charged by sitting on the stand.  If the trimmer starts to die before you are finished, you are out of luck.<br /><br />The motor on this is very quite.  It is easily the quickest one I've every owned.  However, that benefit is probably achieved by under powering the motor.  I found the 4050 to have a little more power, which means the 4070 which is also cheaper then this, may have a lot more power then this.  I found myself having to do some extra passes with this.<br /><br />The biggest benefit of this trimmer is probably the fact that you can use it in the shower, and clean it by running water through it.  The draw back is the maintenance that is required because ofthis.  In a time when more and more trimmers are becoming Maintenance-free, this trimmer requires you to oil it's blades both before and after each use.  With that said, I still find it faster to wash this under water and apply 3 drops of oil, then have to clean the trimmer with a brush.<br /><br />I actually like the comb, it feels fine against my face and doesn't scratch.  However taking it off does feel odd sometimes, and sometimes it does feel like you have to force it off and it might break.  With that said the trimmer does feel like it is solidly made, so maybe it's something I'll get us to.<br /><br />As for the price.  I do think this is overpriced.  I live in Toronto, Canada.  At Future Shop this was priced regularly at $69, the Philips 4050 was at $49 and the 4070 at 64.  I got it on sale for 59.  I would not buy this for regular price, and honestly if I had to replace it, I wouldn't spend $59 on again either.  This shouldn't be price more then Philips 4050 at $49.<br /><br />In the end, like I mentioned at the top, this is a decent trimmer, but is nothing to write home about, and it is very overpriced.  It has some nice benefits, but also some huge negatives.  It does the job, but there are trimmer that do just as good of a job at a lot cheaper price.[EOS]

[BOS]I had never seen an item like this before, one that combines a flashlight with a pocket Knife.[SEP]I would like it better if the cover was the same color and quality as the knife itself is.[SEP]I had never seen an item like this before, one that combines a flashlight with a pocket Knife.  At first one would think that it was designed to illuminate an object that you are cutting however I can see a more useful and frequent need for this product.<br /><br />I own many smallish flashlights and many smallish pocket knives because they are convenient items to have around.  I am not a hunter but I find a need for both a light and a knife many times during a day.  This is where I think that this knife fills a niche that few other product fill.  I can clip it to my belt or stick it in my pocket (at least in my state) and have it handy for when I need it.<br /><br />The knife blade was shipped with a good edge on it although I was able to give it a "shave-worthy" edge with just a little effort.  The handle feels cheaper that I would have desired, mostly because of the external battery covers that essentially becomes your gripping surface.  They can be removed in order to exchange the batteries and the knife comes with a tiny screw driver to facilitate the removal of the hex-screws.  I would like it better if the cover was the same color and quality as the knife itself is.[EOS]
[BOS]I have always wanted a grandfather's clock but live in a one bedroom apartment so it would be too big.[SEP]It is made in China - but is well made.[SEP]I have always wanted a grandfather's clock but live in a one bedroom apartment so it would be too big.  I decided to get a mantel clock instead.  I received this clock on Friday, and I love it!  It is very well made and solid!  It is just the right size for my apartment and the chimes sound wonderful.  I decided on this particular clock because of the Seiko name and the reviews written about it.  It takes one C battery - not the AA that is noted in the description. The battery is included.  I love that you can adjust the volume.  Living in an apartment building I didn't want to annoy the neighbors.  I have it set about 1/2 way and it is plenty loud for me.  I noticed when I tried putting it below halfway that it didn't chime at all.  It has the option of turning off the chimes at night.  There are also 2 different chime selections.  I have always loved the Westminster chimes so that is what I have mine set at.  I find it quite soothing and my cat isn't annoyed by it either.  I keep the chimes on 24x7 and am a light sleeper - but am not bothered by it at all. It chimes every 15 minutes and chimes out the hours at the top of the hour.  It appears to be keeping great time.  The price is very reasonable too.  I would highly recommend it.  I shot a short video of it and posted it to my FB wall - and have received great comments about it.  One of my friends at work told her husband she wants one for Christmas.  It is an impressive little clock.  It is made in China - but is well made.[EOS]

[BOS]I'll just admit it up front: My eyes aren't what they used to be.[SEP]Otherwise a terrific product.[SEP]I'll just admit it up front: My eyes aren't what they used to be.  And so, confronted with a do-it-yourself soldering project on an auto circuit board in which the online guru who suggests the repair was careful to mention how difficult it would be to see what you were be doing without magnification, I bought this headset. And was it ever useful.  The guru was right.  I couldn't anything with my natural eyes.<br /><br />Fortunately with this deice you get 3 levels of magnification, and I ended up using the more powerful 2, including the little round magnifying glass that swings down in front of one eye.  It was just what the doctor called for and allowed to ace the repair job with screwing it up.<br /><br />One the note of doctor, no this isn't the quality of device that you'll find your dentist or surgeon wearing, or even the jeweler down the street, but for the occasional do-it-yourself project it's perfect, and at an incredible price.<br /><br />You do have to lean in quite close to your project to get the focus correct, and this is where the little light comes in very handy.  It swivels from side to side so you can focus the beam on your work.  This is especially useful when using the round glass magnifying as you have to close one eye to see through it, thus your head ends up little off center over your project.<br /><br />No batteries came with the product, so you'll dig up a pair of Triples A's, and you'll also want to tighten down the screws on either side of the eyepiece holder, otherwise the glass wants to sit on your nose, and this simply isn't comfortable.  Otherwise a terrific product.[EOS]

This room sized rug is very attractive, nice cushion to it and very soft.  The colors are a tiny bit brighter than the picture but not by much at all.  The most concerning factor to me was the odor some people have mentioned in their reviews... fortunately for me there was absolutely NO odor at all.  I was able to put this out myself, no help needed.  Nice quality rug while I got a deal on it, it is definitely worth the full price.  I would buy this brand again.[EOS]

I was so sore that it was discouraging me from working out. I wanted to continue making great progress toward my goal but without the joint pain. I did some research and read several reviews about Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM. I decided to try Kirkland brand and it worked pretty well. Pain subsided a bit but my joints were still achy, but a definite improvement. These tablets are also really big and difficult to swallow. I found another supplement called Flexadrene that contains Glucosamine, Chondriotin and MSM along with over 20 other ingredients that relieve joint pain [[ASIN:B00NOG20ZK Flexadrene – Complete Joint Care Formula]]I have been taking these for a month and my joint pain is all but gone and my workout regimen is even more intense. Plus, the Flexadrene pills are much easier to swallow. Overall, this is a good product, but if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, I suggest trying Flexadrene.[EOS]

[BOS]I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.[SEP]Sorely disappointed and will make sure I can see products from this company before purchasing again.[SEP]I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He is an attorney, and I thought its appearance was just his style---elegant and simple.  He takes great care of his belongings.  After 2 months of carrying this brief case, one of the sides ripped from the strap.  This was suppose to be made of leather....instead, it's plastic (or pleather, maybe).  In the beginning, I was suspicious of buying a so called "quality" brief case for only $75.  I should've stuck with my instincts.  When the piece arrived, it was evident why this case was so inexpensive. It's definitely something you wouldn't want to carry in front of professionals.  Being the kind soul he is, he carried it until the strap ripped from the side.  I do not advise wasting your time or money.  Since the expiration date for the return was a month after he had it, we are now unable to return for full amt.  I suppose little amt is better than none....we'll see.  Sorely disappointed and will make sure I can see products from this company before purchasing again.[EOS]

[BOS]1945 is year zero, the year in which the real battle for peace began in many ways.[SEP]Those interested in history would do well to put this on their reading list.[SEP]1945 is year zero, the year in which the real battle for peace began in many ways. Ian Buruma sets out to write a history of that year; but more than that - he examines the aftermath of the war. Little known facts and incidents populate this book, even if one has been a frequent reader of this time period's history. At points a reader can be caught off guard by some of the comparisons. The celebration of VE Day is compared to Beatle mania. The structure of his writing can also be confusing in places. He writes about Germany and then in the next sentence of Japan, without a comparison or a break in the organization.<br /><br />Much of the study is not so much about the rebuilding after the war, but the horrors still inflicted on the people that survived and their fight to survive the peace. Even rations were cut in Britain after the armistice. The retributions of soldiers and civilians, the rejection of soldiers returning by friends and relatives are examined. We learn of graves opened in the search for valuables and gold teeth, and dead crows for sale for food. This is not really the reconstruction, but the roadblocks that came after the war.<br /><br />This is a hard read, to know of the killings and revenge that fill its pages. It is, in many places a tough view of human behavior; but we also see the very hard attempts to bring the shattered countries and people back to a semblance of normal life. There is an outstanding analysis of the British electorates' rejection of Churchill.<br /><br />Still, even with the choppiness in some of the writing and of various sentence structures; this is still a must read for those who wish to learn of the time after WWII and the attempt to make peace, despite the terrors many faced. Those interested in history would do well to put this on their reading list.[EOS]

Fortunately for me, upon my knife’s arrival, there was little for me to critique or complain about, as all the con’s that were covered from other reviewers seemed non-existent. Upon opening, the blade came very sharp, straight, much larger than expected, with the scabbarb (sheath) perfectly intact. There is plenty of reach (I’d like to reiterate "PLENTY”) with 13” overall length and a great piercing ability from everything that I have dealt with outdoors thus far. The Pakkawood handle provides great comfort, and feels very well balanced between the blade and the entire knife.<br /><br />Overall, a very well made product and I would recommend this knife to any outdoors or even indoor individual!

[BOS]I just recently ordered these about a week ago and just received them in the mail.[SEP]If I am able to take time out of my life to type this out, I appreciate anyone that read these before they buy, because of genuine people like me take pride in where my money is spent.[SEP]I just recently ordered these about a week ago and just received them in the mail.  THESE ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE IN THE DESCRIPTION.  They are flimsy and instead of being chrome, it is like a duct tape silver color.  It looks a bit 3D in the picture , but mines are flat and looks like something i can buy at Wal-Mart.  Also the description says 3M tape on the back, that is false as well.  I am so dissatisfied that I called them with the card they sent me to attempt to ask them if they were aware of problem that it doesn't match the description online ... the response I received from the lady that spoke to me was .. "SO DO YOU WANT A REFUND?" .. this makes me more upset because there was no proper answer given or customer service given to me besides telling me to ship it back but its going to cost me about the same to ship it back for a measly 12 dollars i spent.  Instead of shipping it back and getting that money back, I rather type up this review and be more satisfied that no one else makes anymore purchases from these guys because I am damn sure there items does not match item descriptions.  So PLEASE BEWARE AND BE CAREFUL, don't waste your hard earned money on cheats like this.  Honestly those positive comments seem to good to be true, even though i was betting on them to be real, but this is the internet and those comments might be from this company making alias creating those positive comments themselves.

[BOS]Compared to my other Whoopie Pie cookbook, this one is user friendly -- at least for the first section of the book.[SEP]The book's organization is a bit confusing and decisions like the inclusions in the last chapter simply strange, but the recipe I prepared was delicious and I look forward to trying more.[SEP]Compared to my other Whoopie Pie cookbook, this one is user friendly -- at least for the first section of the book. A recipe for the cake is on one page and the suggested filling recipe follows on the next. Of course the user is free to mix-up cakes and fillings but it is nice to have the basics follow in sequential order rather than chapters filled with nothing but cakes and some filled with nothing but fillings so the user must jump from one section to the next.  The book is a paperback so it doesn't lay open flat on the countertop. The use of a cookbook holder might be helpful. The ink color for the recipes and instructions is mercifully, black, so even with the small font size it is relatively easy to read. The paper quality is good and promptly wiped-up spills did not sink in and cause permanent damage. There is a solid index in the back so locating a particular recipe is easy. The measurements are given in grams and ounces. The majority of necessary ingredients are readily available in grocery stores, but golden syrup will require a search.  I made the Carrot Cake Whoopie pie along with the recommended Orange Mascarpone Cream filling. The combination was excellent and I won't hesitate to prepare it again, although I plan to try other varieties.  Recipes included in the Simple and Sweet section of the book are Chocolate with Fluffy Marshmallow filling, Mocha-Orange with Espresso cream filling, Pumpkin with Cream Cheese filling, Strawberry with Strawberry buttercream, Chocolate Chip with Chocolate Marshmallow cream, Carrot Cake with Orange Mascarpone cream, Lemon Cream with Lemon Curd cream, Red Velvet with Old Fashioned buttercream and Salty Caramel with Caramel Swiss buttercream.  Moving into the next few sections of the book the organization starts to drift a bit between icings, glazes, whoopie pie cakes, fillings and buttercreams. Recipes include, Teacake Whoopie, Chocolate icing, Kirsch Swiss buttercream, Rose-Pistachio Whoopie, Rosewater icing, Plain icing, Vanilla Swiss buttercream, Walnut Whip Whoopie, Meringue Whoopie, Chestnut cream, Coconut Cream Whoopie, Coconut Swiss buttercream, Coconut glaze, Raspberry and Nectarine Whoopie, Vanilla Bean cream, Raspberry Sauce, Blackberry Whoopie, Blackberry cream, Blackberry-Geranium sauce, Rhubarb & Custard Whoopie, Roasted Rhubarb, Banana Cream Whoopie, Chocolate Sauce and Shavings, Salty Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Custard Cream.  Recipes for Frozen and Chilled Whoopies where ice cream is used or an accompanying noted filling include, Oatmeal Cookie Whoopie (use vanilla ice cream,) Key Lime Whoopie, frozen Key Lime cream, Chocolate Mint Whoopie and frozen Mint Chip cream. Holiday treats include Christmas Cake Whoopie, Brown Sugar Spice buttercream, Spooky Halloween Whoopie, Easter Egg Whoopie and Multicolored Buttercreams.  Completely puzzling, at this point the book abandons its subject -- Whoopie Pies --and includes recipes for S'mores (yes, basic graham cracker, chocolate bar and toasted marshmallow s'mores,) Peanut Butter sandwich cookies with peanut butter filling, Easy Chocolate Macaroons, Chocolate-Caramel Ganache, Prize Peach Cobbler, Butterscotch Blondies and finally a Brownie Sundae.  The book's organization is a bit confusing and decisions like the inclusions in the last chapter simply strange, but the recipe I prepared was delicious and I look forward to trying more.[EOS]

[BOS]I have several GPS products and have always been happy with them and have held up well.[SEP]Nice addition to their family for SMALL guns.[SEP]I have several GPS products and have always been happy with them and have held up well.  I was looking for sleeve to fit in my range bags.  Found these sleeves.  Let's start with size:    Outside Dimensions:  5.25" x 8" (zipped closed with no gun inside)  Unzipped Flat:  8.25"11.25" including the zipper portion 7.5"x 10" for the inside padded part  Thickness folded:  1" each 1/2 of the sleeve is 1/2" thick  Inside pistol carrying area: 4.5"x 7" area that your gun can fit in and allow a bit more for the zipper (about the size of of man's hands (normal paws)    This will fit a compact gun with conditions; either the mag is out or you don't have any extension on the mag:  Bersa Thunder 380 fits without mag in  Glock 42 will fit without mag in  Ruger SR22 without mag in  Ruger SR9C/40C are a a bit tight without mag in  EAA Windicator  SCCY CPX-2 without mag in    You can put the mag in the sleeve but not in the gun without a tight fit.    There are no extra pockets etc.  It is meant for a sleeve and that is it.  No extra mag spots etc.   Heavy stitching and stings on the zipper so you can get a hold of them.    Lockable as well.    The GPS logo has Velcro on so you can remove it.    It unzips to lay flat to put your pistol on at the range which is a nice touch or you can rest your forehead on it if you need pillow!    The inside is the same nylon as the outside and the same product as all their other bags.    I bought these with the intention of putting pistols in and then putting in the range bag so not having the mag in the gun is not a big deal for my purposes.  If you are wanting to keep you pistol in bag with the mag in it, it is almost going to be too tight unless you have a derringer!      They call this MEDIUM size.  I would disagree, it is more a SMALL.  I would hate to see their "small".    Nice addition to their family for SMALL guns.[EOS]

[BOS]My husband has very poor eyesight and his glasses can do only so much to correct it, so he uses a magnifying glass regularly for many things.[SEP]With those two modifications, I'd give this a 5-star rating.[SEP]My husband has very poor eyesight and his glasses can do only so much to correct it, so he uses a magnifying glass regularly for many things.  This little tool has made his life much, much easier when it comes to working on his electronics (he's an electronics hobbyist and does a lot of spot-welding and other things).  At first I was a bit dismayed at how small this is; the magnifying glass is just a bit over 2 inches wide and the base is only about an inch and a half.  However, the Helping Hand seems to be big enough for almost everything my husband has needed, and the adjustable hinges work very smoothly.  So far he's used it for soldering jobs, fixing eyeglass hinges and threading needles (yeah, he sews too!).  I only wish the base had machined holes so that one could anchor the whole tool to a workbench if one wanted, and it wouldn't hurt if the glass was just a bit larger.  With those two modifications, I'd give this a 5-star rating.[EOS]

[BOS]There's a lot of mixed reviews.[SEP]The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.[SEP]There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.[EOS]

[BOS]I've worn Rainbows for years.[SEP]I might end up trimming them.[SEP]I've worn Rainbows for years.  When I lived in a warmer area, I wore them pretty much every day, all day.

I only replaced them when the padding started to wear out and not protect my heals.<br /><br />The double layer makes these extra comfortable, but you need to realize that rainbows must be broken it.  They are like a pair of leather boots in that they're uncomfortable until broken in.  Once that happens, they are perfect.

[BOS]After purchasing my stand up paddle board and accessories I thought what better to get than the Nocqua Adventure gear Spectrum 7-color LED light system.[SEP]I'm hoping other's won't have the same experience.[SEP]After purchasing my stand up paddle board and accessories I thought what better to get than the Nocqua Adventure gear Spectrum 7-color LED light system.  I ordered it with Prime and patiently waited two days for it to arrive, the day it arrived I could hardly wait - a moon lit paddle with my expensive lighting on the bottom of the SUP was just what I needed to relax.  When opening the box I was greeted with a nicely made holster for the device that housed the lighting system.  The led lights are nicely made and the adapters all have water proof connections.  When I connected the light up to the battery Viola! NOTHING!  After checking the instructions and verifying the connections, I figured maybe the battery was dead or had low power/voltage, I plugged the battery pack into the charger and waited for about four hours (the led light on the charger went from red to green).  I plugged everything back together and pressed the button hoping for fluorescence - nope.  I called the manufacturer (Nocqua), and was given no reassurance of ever fixing my light, the answer was, &#34;oh, just ship it back to Amazon and order another,&#34; I decided to spend $400 bucks elsewhere, perhaps this was a fluke, or maybe I should have just re-ordered another, but I would think something this expensive would work the first time.

[BOS]I got these for Christmas and I love them![SEP]I've had these headphones for 6 months now, and I don't think I'll be changing headphones for a long long time =)

-Andy[SEP]I got these for Christmas and I love them! I also got them for my brother. The ears are a little big for me, as they go down my neck a bit, but I am quite small so that's my problem. My brother is huge and he says they fit fine. I can wear these for 4 or so hours before starting to feel pain from the headband and clamp,(which is kind of hard not to have for this type of headphone). This wasn't a big issue for me because I only use them a couple of hours at a time, and I was willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort for quality, and even at that they are still pretty darn comfortable! Overall there isn't much clamp, it just builds up after uaing them for a long time. The ears themselves are comfortable (lined with a soft cushion) and provide AMAZING isolation!! These babies made the airplane drone sound like a gentle hum. The quality is superb if you're moving from Apple earbuds or Skullcandy's or beats--the beats really are bad quality for their price--anyway, music sounds clear and crisp and gives a bit of a soundstage effect. Drums can sometimes sound a little punchy, and there can be a big bass but both arent overwhelming. They are big so if portability is a must, these might not be for you, though the ears do fold over and it does come with a chic travel case...You just cant put them in your sweatshirt pocket or anything. DO NOT GET THE S CABLE IF YOU ONLY WANT TO USE THEM FOR YOUR COMPUTER/IPOD. I made that mistake and I had to get an adapter, which was only $7 from Radio Shack, but I'm not downrating the product as that mistake was my own. I don't think a headphone ampilfier is needed for these, but they do sound better after some useage. I've had these headphones for 6 months now, and I don't think I'll be changing headphones for a long long time =)<br /><br />-Andy[EOS]

[BOS]Yes, the French have them, too.[SEP]For those who'd like a comparison, one might
say it's a bit like The Boy Friend with an erotic edge.[SEP]Yes, the French have them, too. Directed with great style, this film seems tres moderne, though its stage source dates<br />from 1925. The adaptation is really quite faithful, too. Best of all, the English subtitles fall in with the general<br />goofiness of the plot and add to the fun--like when one character is likened to "un flamand" (the Flemish traditionally being the French stereotype for "uncouth")and the subtitles say he's from Carlisle, presumably a wild and wooly English town. Lambert Wilson is extra fun. He's bilingual, and puts on an extremely funny spoof of an American's French pronunciation.<br />I imagine some viewers won't think this is a musical at all, because the<br />numbers sort of slither in without warning. But there's a lot of singing. For those who'd like a comparison, one might<br />say it's a bit like The Boy Friend with an erotic edge.[EOS]

Over all, I should of went with different lighting.[EOS]

[BOS]Alright everybody knows what Call of Duty is really about and that is multiplayer.[SEP]Overall, campaign is a flop, but the zombies and multiplayer is the by far the best in the franchise.[SEP]Alright everybody knows what Call of Duty is really about and that is multiplayer. It is Treyarch's bread and butter and it makes people keep coming back for more. Yes there is zombies and campaign but multiplayer caters to most CoD fans out there so this review will be multiplayer biased. I can say that zombies are fun based on experience but I cannot say the same for the campaign for those interested.<br /><br />There is a new pick ten system which allows people to build a class catering to their play style. Personally I like this new approach as it allow me to play the way I want without certain in game limits. There is also a new mode called league play which puts players of equal ability next to each other. I really liked this because I would consistently get chopper gunners and high skill steaks in older games and as fun as that sounds to people it got old really fast.  I have been on the receiving end of high skill streaks too and understand that is just as good a reason to quit the game. Now by playing people of similar skill it is a challenge to win and there is a reward to keep playing the game! Additionally people who don't play as often will be placed with similar skill so there will be less frustration!<br /><br />People complain a lot about hit markers and lag but that is not been a problem for me. I've seen the youtube videos and it is often an excuse for bad play. The lag is minimal in this game, if there is lag it boots the host and gets a better connection. I play with best connection on all the time, which may be the solution to the lag issue. Also realize the Cod series has been out for a while and some people are seasoned vets so I recommend league play for new players as they will get matched with other new players looking to learn the ropes of the game.<br /><br />Treyarch has embraced the competitive community in this game more than ever. I like this mostly because the competitive community is likely to support the game till the end of its run.  I feel as though it is unjust to ignore the competitive community when casual gamers will have likely have moved on 3 months into release. Realize too the result of competitive gaming is a more balanced and clean playing game for everyone.<br /><br />Even if competitive isn't your fancy there is plenty to keep the casual gamer interested for quite a long time. 2/4 map packs have been released and zombies has been beefed up quite a bit since world at war. There is so much more to unlock and customize this time around.  Say what you want about the series, but nothing still beats going into a lobby with your friends (virtual or not) and wreaking havoc on the enemy. No other FPS does that better than Call of duty black ops 2 does today.<br /><br />Overall, campaign is a flop, but the zombies and multiplayer is the by far the best in the franchise.[EOS]

[BOS]We stopped eating Jello years ago, because of the toxic dyes, fake flavoring and other crap ingredients.[SEP]The Jel had been completely devoured by the kids before I could correct my mistake![SEP]We stopped eating Jello years ago, because of the toxic dyes, fake flavoring and other crap ingredients.  I (ok, my daughter) spotted this Bakol Jel Strawberry dessert in the grocery store last week (about $3.50 a package) and was very happy to see this cleaner, non gmo version.  It's made with 100% natural ingredients, non gmo, gluten free, and certified vegan.  It is not as vibrant as usual Jello, but so what.  It's so much better for you, so try to deal with it.  We tried making the Jel in our old Jello molds, and it actually came out ok, not as firm as jello but it still held its shape.  However, it is more watery, so when making it, I decrease the water it calls for a bit.  Also, if you let the set Jel warm to room temperature, it becomes very runny.  The taste is good though, very strawberry, but not in the intense, fake and artificial way.  If you are expecting something exactly like Jello, you will be disappointed.  If you have been searching for a cleaner alternative to jello, give this Bakol Jel a chance. We are happy to have found it, because the kids can finally have (occasionally) their gelatin dessert. The ingredients are: evaporated cane juice, vegetable gum, citric acid, potassium citrate, natural flavor, beet powder. I apologize for taking a picture of it on an orange plate, it's hard to see the color (which is a pale pink).  The Jel had been completely devoured by the kids before I could correct my mistake![EOS]

[BOS]I had a hard time rating this, as I really like the piece, but it has a major design flaw.[SEP]If you don't feel like fiddling with it, you may want to find another shelf.[SEP]I had a hard time rating this, as I really like the piece, but it has a major design flaw. The carving on this is beautiful. It looks higher-end than it is- if you want it to keep looking that way, a low-traffic usage is key. You need to be careful with it, as the finish dings easily. Which brings me to the finish: it's a deep red-brown: think cherry mixed with mahogany. The color looks NOTHING like the picture on my monitor. I was actually pleasantly surprised, since it matches my hardwood floors and a lot of my furniture, but if you are looking for a lighter, more "golden" finish, you are going to be disappointed.<br /><br />I bought this to hang as a mantel. I figured it would come with the jagged "toothy" hangers that are used to typically hang such things, and well- no. Two keyhole hangers. The main problem here is that the top of the keyhole opening is flush with the underside of the mantel shelf. So the shelf will actually be resting on whatever you use to hang it, screws/nails/etc.-which will hold it up. But if bumped or pulled on, the shelf will probably slip right off the fasteners and the wall. If you're dealing with a brick surface like I am, this is even more problematic, because the shelf will get scratched up, and whatever is on the shelf will probably smash to pieces.<br /><br />If you want this, my advice is to upgrade the wall fasteners to something more secure. If you don't feel like fiddling with it, you may want to find another shelf.[EOS]

The battery was not fully charged, but I had no issues with brightness.<br /><br />I use the 18650 batteries in my vape  device. I always have two with me. With the battery that was included, I have plenty of light.<br /><br />The tail light was a nice bonus.<br /><br />Overall I love the light. The different modes will be great for camping. I got a great multipurpose light for a bargain price! Batteries alone cost 1/3 the price of the light. The mounts for my bike and the tail light would cost another 20. Wow.... We reached the price of the light before it was added to the equation.<br /><br />Thanks for a great product..[EOS]

[BOS]This is a tough one.[SEP]Anyway, the apparent cinematic influences are enough to keep things interesting, so while I was a bit disappointed this time, I'd gladly give this author's work another spin.[SEP]This is a tough one.  Coming away from this book, I can say that I love Shari Goldhagen's sense of the fragility of relationships and her empathy for often profoundly unsympathetic characters.  This is an author who lives for the cognitive dissonance experienced by all of us as we drift away from and sometimes back towards the people we see ourselves as truly being.  She has an exceptional ear for dialogue, which is probably at the top of my wish list for any writer.    I also feel like this novel must have been rushed to press or simply given up on at some point mid-rewrite.  There are contrivances that reek of coincidence, a science fiction conceit that might have actually paid off more satisfyingly had the author really taken a left turn very literally into another universe or two, and an already much-commented-on bit of weirdness where one character is addressed in the second person for reasons that remain entirely opaque.  If I'm just being dense about this last part, I'm clearly in good company.    And then there's the sex.  It's neither salacious nor gratuitous, but somehow jarring, particularly as concerns the character of Phoebe, who for awhile seems to be well on her way to being a fading-starlet-wannabee-turned-call-girl. There is a payoff of a sort with the setup, but with so many YA ("Young Adult" genre) elements to this story, it feels somehow out of place, as does another character's very inappropriate youthful tryst with a stepparent. (One that could only have been characterized as abusive had the genders there been switched.)    A further bit of weirdness here is personal to me.  I chose this book for the blurb, which mentioned Orlando, FL, I believe, as well as Chicago (turns out to be more Skokie/Evanston), Los Angeles and Cincinatti.  I'm very familiar with three of these cities and have a passing acquaintance with the fourth.  I was once a teenage sci fi geek.  I realize the mention here is something of a non-sequitor, but I found the author's sense of place to be utterly convincing, and am in a reasonably unique position to know.    "In Some Other World..." reflects an eclectic heritage, and a sufficiently schlocky press release might make comparisons to "The Breakfast Club", "The Big Chill", heck, maybe even "Galaxy Quest".  Anyway, the apparent cinematic influences are enough to keep things interesting, so while I was a bit disappointed this time, I'd gladly give this author's work another spin.[EOS]

[BOS]I got these on a whim.[SEP]A very inexpensive and handy tool well beyond its intended uses.[SEP]I got these on a whim.  I needed a set of accurate dividers for fine woodworking projects that involved copying and transfering small measurements - at the level of a few thousandths.  The human eye can recognize irregularities at that level and errors can destroy the aesthetics of the project.  I thought about getting a set of Groz calipers that comes with a divider, but I already had inside and outside calipers and i didn't want to spend $50 just to get a divider.  Then i came by this EKG caliper as an Amazon add-on for $6.31 so i got it.<br /><br />These calipers are great.  they are very well made and very sturdy.  Their maximum span is 7.5", but the effective usable span is more like 7", so they're not well suited for cabinet work, cutting sheet stock, and wood turning.  But for precision joinery, laying out dovetail joints, duplicating precise dado's, etc. these are just the ticket.  The arm tension is adjustable via two small set screws, and the points are replaceable.  These points are sharp and may also serve as an occasional light-duty scribe.  The points are protected with a convenient hard plastic cover which works fine.  My cover fits tightly enough to stay on in my pocket, but caliper placement in woodworking is primarily an out-of-pocket experience, so tightness doesn't matter much.<br /><br />At $6 these calipers are a great deal for anyone who needs to measure, transfer or step off small distances, scribe small circles, create simple geometrical patterns, etc.  The advantages over standard flat leg dividers for woodworking are that these dividers are precision-made, the points are ground to a precise center, and that they firmly hold their span for duplicating measurements, where most of woodworking dividers I'm familiar with use a threaded cap to hold the span which is far less convenient.  This would also be useful in metalworking small objects on mills, lathes, etc. which I don't do any more.  It will not replace the Trammel point - but for smallmeasurement, this is simpler and more accurate.<br /><br />This might also be useful with navigational charts, small part duplication, accurate metalworking, etc.  A very inexpensive and handy tool well beyond its intended uses.[EOS]

[BOS]Great fountain for the price - about 1/2 price of that in the big-brand pet stores.[SEP]Very happy with the quality and materials.[SEP]Great fountain for the price - about 1/2 price of that in the big-brand pet stores.  Has adjustable water flow (great flow!) that can be turned up or down easily.  Simple to take apart to clean.  We have a lot of minerals in our water, so I clean it about once every 2-3 weeks.  While this would last with water in it for several weeks, I like to change out the water at least once a week to keep it fresh (although the charcoal filter does a good job of that).  I have one cat in our household, but I would imagine a home that had more pets might want to change it more frequently.<br /><br />After some months, sometimes I notice that fur (my cat has thick, long-hair) might get caught in the pump and it will slow down some, but with this new model, the fountain is easily dismantled to get to the pump (other models weren't so easy to get to it) and give it a good rinsing.  Quick to do: takes less than 2 minutes to remove top part, get at and take out pump, rinse it off, put the pump back in and replace the top.  Easy-peasy!<br /><br />The water flows fairly quietly, but there is a little bit of a soft fountain water noise - which I really like.  Sounds like a far-off stream, so it is a very pleasant sound.  I know my kitty likes this fountain, because not only does she have nice, clean water all the time, but she liked to drink from the faucets before (which I didn't really care for) and now with the fountain, she'll drink directly from the water coming out of the spout so she is happy.  :-)<br /><br />I have had this same brand before (but in a larger size reservoir), and liked it well enough that this is my 3rd purchase over the past many years.  I have tried other brands/types, but I like this one the best as there is no dripping or leaks (from the unit... when we had the dog, he would lap the water messily and drool/drip it all over the place - not due to any malfunction of the fountain though).<br /><br />This is a well-made and sturdy unit; if/when I ever need to replace it, I would get the same one again.  Very happy with the quality and materials.[EOS]

A college student is in love with Lauren who has turned into a meth-head. He tries to free her from her addiction but ends up giving himself to her and her demons.<br /><br />The Dowry is another of my favorites. A family is totally against the marriage of their daughter and is about to kill her fiance when a pastor steps in to make things right and evens up the score.<br /><br />All of the stories have panache and I read them aloud to my husband as we were driving. It was great to hear the words spoken and to share the book with someone else. It is a welcome addition to Rash's repertoire of works and I plan to read his other short stories soon. For those of you who enjoyed 'Serena', these stories will not be disappointing.[EOS]

[BOS]I shop at Serbags often because I love the quality of their bags.[SEP]I completely recommend using Serbags, as they provide outstanding products![SEP]I shop at Serbags often because I love the quality of their bags. I actually bought this bag through their main website but decided I would share my thought on amazon so everyone could understand how awesome these bags really are. The quality is outstanding. I have been using this bag for about a year and there is no sign of ware and it is as durable as the day I bought it.<br /><br />I get complements all the time on the army inspired look. The bag is made to hold a large amount of content, and contains all the comfort I have been looking for in a messenger bag. I love the cushion that is on the shoulder strap, it is really helpful when carrying a heavy load. I have dealt with Serbags customer care as well and they are outstanding.<br /><br />The pockets on the sides and front are so nice when wanting access items quickly.

[BOS]We have tried Bummis, Kushies, Imse Vimse, and at least one other type of diaper liner.[SEP]It doesn't seem right that this company can change the product but not the packaging or label![SEP]We have tried Bummis, Kushies, Imse Vimse, and at least one other type of diaper liner. In my opinion, the Kushies are the absolute best quality, because they are the right size and are soft and easy to dispense (roll). But they are much more expensive than the CuteyBaby liners, especially in the 6 pack. With CuteyBaby we have found our favored liners. I have not had the leakage problems others have reported. I actually like that they aren't very absorbent, because I usually reuse them if it's just pee in the diaper.<br /><br />Update: July 13, 2012<br />The newest package of these that I received from Amazon are packaged identically to the others I have received; however, they are a different product. The old ones are soft and look like dryer sheets, with a very fine mesh. The new ones are like drywall tape with a very large mesh. They are not as soft as the older version, and they stick to baby more. It doesn't seem right that this company can change the product but not the packaging or label![EOS]

[BOS]This is my second time mounting a projector on the ceiling.[SEP]this is the perfect mount for the projector.[SEP]This is my second time mounting a projector on the ceiling. My first projector was the Epson Powerlite HC 2000, and I figured that being kind of handy I could save some money and go with a universal mount. Let me tell you, that was a mistake I will never make again. Universal mounts are supposed to be made to fit any projector, thereby requiring you to figure which out of the 9000 pieces they give will work for your projector. Again, given enough time I can usually figure things out, and I made it work, but it wasn't worth my time let alone the 30 or so bucks I saved.<br /><br />So, I recently bought the Optoma HD141x and while looking through the mount selection, I came across this mount which is specifically designed for this projector. To put it plain and simple, IF YOU ARE BUYING THE OPTOMA HD 141x, BUY THIS MOUNT!!! Setup was a breeze and this thing is so reasonably priced. This mount is attractive and unobtrusive, and blends right in with the projector. It only sends you the pieces you need and the instructions are simple and clear. It is so easy to adjust the projector to line up perfectly with the screen... just make sure you do your homework and place it the proper distance. I mounted in a drywall ceiling, using two anchor type screws that are simple, effective and sturdy. This mount is the way to go, don't be fooled by the low price and assume quality has been sacricficed... this is the perfect mount for the projector.[EOS]
[BOS]This is a good Jasmine tea.[SEP]If you can afford it, always go with high grade leaves.[SEP]This is a good Jasmine tea. Not great but good.  Its light as green teas tend to be but the jasmine gives it a soothing aroma and interesting taste.  The only thing is that it does have an odd taste I can't put my finger on. Not that it's bad, it's not at all, just leaves you wondering, "What is that flavor?" It's interesting to say the least.  Otherwise, this is an extremely relaxing tea as most Jasmines tend to be.<br /><br />I would have preferred a smaller size to start with but this was the only option, at least on amazon.  I also ordered a higher grade version of jasmine at the same time; [[ASIN:B00HFMON0Y Organic Jasmine Pearls Loose Leaf Green Tea 4 oz. + FREE Blueberry Pomegranate White Tea 2 oz]]  Hhmm, that free blueberry pom was not offered to me in my last order.  Anyway, I steeped this tea for 5 minutes and was just amazed by its fragrance.  I love the amazing floral note from this jasmine, no foreign taste in this one that I cannot put my finger on.  If you can afford it, always go with high grade leaves.[EOS]

[BOS]Ever wonder where all the spy/intrigue shows in the movies and on television get their ideas for panoramas of crime scenes from such tiny hidden sources?[SEP]Grady Harp, October 14[SEP]Ever wonder where all the spy/intrigue shows in the movies and on television get their ideas for panoramas of crime scenes from such tiny hidden sources? Well, here is a device from Polaroid no less that does just that. Attach this tiny cube to anything that will stay stationary (or not!) and turn it on and see the 124" wide angle imagery in motion - going down the ski slopes, the madness of the skateboarders with one of these little cubes clipped to the baseball cap, or just stand still and capture the beauty of nature in an entirely new way.<br /><br />The built in battery runs for at least 90 continuous minutes - if things like this were allowed in concert halls that would be enough time to record an entire symphony! Right now it is a toy - likely further development will make it yet another way to ignore privacy in the social media mode (hopefully not). Grady Harp, October 14[EOS]

[BOS]You should be aware that this stuff is sticky on both sides.[SEP]All told, I'm very happy with the results I achieved.[SEP]You should be aware that this stuff is sticky on both sides.  I used it like regular caulk for an outside gap around a replacement window, and after a month in the elements (somewhat protected by an overhang) it's actually held up very nicely without attracting a lot of dirt or trapping bugs.  I would call the color a medium tone gray.  Fairly rubbery so you want a sharp knife to cut it, but very easy to stick in place using just fingers.  Good adhesion, good quality material.  I couldn't get as smooth a look as with regular caulk, but I was applying it at an awkward angle over my head.  Certainly it was much quicker and easier than using a caulk gun.  No volatile fumes, no messy clean up.  All told, I'm very happy with the results I achieved.[EOS]

[BOS]This bath set is pretty standard, with a tooth brush holder, liquid soap/lotion dispenser, and bar soap holder.[SEP]Apart from the pump, it adds to the look and functionality of my bathroom.[SEP]This bath set is pretty standard, with a tooth brush holder, liquid soap/lotion dispenser, and bar soap holder.  I find the combination of two soap holders redundant and would have preferred an extra holder for things like toothpaste.  The design is great, with a classical shape and pattern that would fit most bathrooms.<br /><br />The material is not metal, but it is thankfully not ceramic either.  Instead, it uses the rugged plastic resin that is common with new sets.  The paint color works well with chrome or nickel fixtures.  Because it is plastic, there is no need for maintenance to avoid rust.  Unfortunately, the pump mechanism is made of a cheap-looking plastic.  I can understand the main components being resin, but using a standard metal pump would have added some class and durability.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this bath set.  Apart from the pump, it adds to the look and functionality of my bathroom.[EOS]

[BOS]We live in a throw away society, a world where everything is expendable and ready to be tossed aside once we've finished with it.[SEP]Hopefully young people will find enough interest to watch this movie and feel a bit of that.[SEP]We live in a throw away society, a world where everything is expendable and ready to be tossed aside once we've finished with it. Kids today seem only interested in themselves and what's going on in the present, never caring what happened before they were born. The saddest part of this is the fact that in being this way they never expose themselves to some of the greatest things in the world, everything from classic novels to pieces of art that have survived centuries. With any luck a few of them will watch THE MONUMENTS MEN and consider doing so.<br /><br />George Clooney stars as Frank Stokes, a military officer in World War II who presents a case to President Roosevelt about the famous works found in museums in Europe. In this presentation he shows Roosevelt famous pieces of art that have gone missing, supposedly taken by Hitler to be put on display when he wins the war in a specially built structure. That is if he doesn't damage them first or if the allies don't damage them while fighting battles from one town to the next. Stokes request is that a special select group of men work to save these pieces of art before they are all destroyed. Given the go ahead, he assembles his team.<br /><br />The team is small. There aren't that many people qualified or willing to be a part. Each has their own role to play in helping with this seemingly impossible task. Included in the group are James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville). These are the Monuments men, the elite group that sets out to fulfill the task Stokes has set forth. Granger is sent undercover to find out as much information as he can concerning the whereabouts of artwork stolen in France. The rest are split into teams and sent searching for other various artifacts.<br /><br />Using various methods they accumulate enough knowledge that they discover a patternused in the transport of these works of art. It appears that each location on the map they point out with the clues presented there are underground mines where the art has been stored, at least in part. As the troops move forward, the team accompanies them in an attempt to fulfill their mission. Placing their lives in danger, not all will come home, but each will play his part in this truly historic mission.<br /><br />This gives you the basic idea of what the movie is about. What it doesn't do is show the admiration these men had for not just the task at hand but the items they were sent to save. While some might find a Rembrandt of a museum quality piece of artwork in a foreign church boring, these men look upon each with reverence and respect. The military might see their job as unworthy of their efforts but a twist results in them finding more than they bargained for.<br /><br />Based on the true story of this team the movie offers it all. There is plenty of camaraderie among the team, an affection that develops between them as they move forward. There is the awe that each one inspires with the items they find. There is humor in various moments where things can be light hearted. And there is tragedy as some fall to the enemy.<br /><br />What makes this movie important though is to consider what it was they actually accomplished. To think that some of these pieces might have disappeared (which some actually did) makes their story one of success where few thought it could happen. That they were able to rescue as much as they did is an amazing feat and one that should be lauded. I found it amazing that it took this long for their story to be told.<br /><br />The movie offers not just great entertainment but a piece of history that all should be made aware of. It's a film that young people should see to realize that there was a world out there before they were born and that many things they take for granted could simply have not been there if not for the efforts ofpeople like this. Ipads, Ipods and Facebook are all great things but not near as great as what these people saved. It would be nice to know that at least a few people in the world appreciate the work that they did. Hopefully young people will find enough interest to watch this movie and feel a bit of that.[EOS]

[BOS]When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's [[ASIN:B0018RC7QE Falling in Love]] (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train.[SEP]Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.[SEP]When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's [[ASIN:B0018RC7QE Falling in Love]] (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel ([[ASIN:B000MKD9P6 The Devil Wears Prada]]) and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.<br /><br />An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does.<br /><br />At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.[EOS]

Although the product description did not list the Kindle among the devices it will hold, I took a  chance based on the dimensions it listed being able to hold. The product is very well made, easy to install and holds on the the Kindle tightly. I was curious is mount could accommodate Kindle in the standing protective case but it did, and it fit so well that even with a good shake or two before I mounted it on the headrest, the Kindle held tightly in place and wouldn't budge. Being aware that flying objects inside a vehicle during an accident are very dangerous to a little one I wanted to make sure that the device was secure before mounting in front of my 2-year old. I like this product so much that I will recommend it to anyone, even an adult that would be sitting in the back seat and wants to mount a device to watch a movie on a long car ride.

I wanted to compare. The CSS sounds much better. The sound is smoother. The bass is fuller. The dialogue is clearer. The remote seems better. And overall, the CSS is a big improvement over the older HTL, which is still for sale, but apparently discontinued. I returned that one to Walmart.<br />I have the CSS hooked up to a new model 32 inch Vizio smart TV with built-in apps. It's a master bedroom application. I think I will keep this unit since it performs well enough. It sounds better on music actually, than as a movie soundbar. Its simulated surround sounds sounds better than the HTL also. That one sounded like too much reverb. I wouldn't turn this unit up much past 30% unless your ears are oblivious to distortion.<br />The remote has adjustments for bass and treble, but they are minimal. This improves on the sounds of the TV speakers, obviously. A bonus is that its not too tall so it doesn't interfere with the TV infrared remote.<br />I have a feeling  the whole TV soundbar craze is going to disappear soon as TV makers figure out ways to make tvs sound better without all this extra junk cluttering up rooms. Soundbars will probably go the way of VHS players and Sony Walkmen in due time. But until then, this $99 unit serves the purpose adequately.[EOS]

A battle, in words and deeds, ensues, with creative special effects and innovative visuals.

[BOS]I bought this flashlight for my dad.[SEP]The battery life is also fairly impressive for the amount of light this thing puts out.[SEP]I bought this flashlight for my dad.  I had it on my wishlist for a while, but nobody bought it for me, so I figured I would get it for my dad.  I usually buy him 1-2 flashlights a year as gifts.  Kind of a running joke in our family that he knows he's either getting a flashlight or a pocket knife from me for a gift.<br /><br />He said this is one of the best flashlights he's ever owned.  In addition to him owning countless flashlights over the years, please also know he was a firefighter and used countless lights on the job as well.  This one gives off a blindingly concentrated beam, but still gives a nice lighter glowing outer ring to let you see things even if they aren't directly in the main beam.<br /><br />This flashlight will light up an entire room inside a house and can EASILY spotlight tree tops outside at 200 yards.  Highly recommended for camping, as an emergency light in your car, or any other use you may have.<br /><br />Two other benefits I've found to this light is that it's made of rubber, so your hand won't freeze in 3 seconds if you pick it up in the middle of winter if it's been in your car.  (Assuming you aren't wearing gloves).  Also, it's not round, so it won't go rolling off the counter or table if you set it down on it's side.  One downside about the rubber, is that it's not dog-chew proof as my dad learned.  His still works, but it has some teeth marks on the battery cap now.<br /><br />Ok, this review is long enough.  Bottom line, while I can rattle off 10 different lights and why you should own all of them, you can't go wrong with this one.  My dad and I both highly recommend it.  The battery life is also fairly impressive for the amount of light this thing puts out.[EOS]

[BOS]I just received this little stool today.[SEP]Those are not big issues for me so I gave it 5 stars for the sleekness and design.[SEP]I just received this little stool today.  The color in the picture is very accurate in comparison to the color of the stool (mink brown).  It is a bit smaller than I expected, but that is no problem since it still fits the vanity perfectly.  When I sit on it I'm still able to look directly into my mirror.  The only think I would caution other consumers about is the height of the stool back.  It's only about five inches high from the seat cushion.  So it doesn't offer any back support.  Those are not big issues for me so I gave it 5 stars for the sleekness and design.[EOS]

Over the course of the party we definitely became partial to another launcher, [[ASIN:B004FRXKEW 300 Yard Water Balloon Launcher]].

The CX Blaster launcher felt like it was made from lower quality rubber and there was visible wear after an afternoon of heavy use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun toy but I wouldn't really suggest the CX Blaster over one of the Bam Launchers.[EOS]

[BOS]Got this for Christmas.[SEP]Bottom line, i only used the actual laptop shell so in the future,  i personally wouldn't need the set.[SEP]Got this for Christmas.  I&#34;m not into matchy matchy things in general.  I like the laptop cover.  Good protection, fun color.  They keyboard cover is super fun but despite it's thin layer, doesn't make the keyboard AS tactile as it is without. Don't get me wrong, it's still decent, but I have another brand on another laptop that cost more, but it's definitely a fraction thinner and makes a difference.  The mouse is really lightweight and kind of plastic-y.  I didn't need the mouse.  And the soft external flapped cover is good, but almost unnecessary since most laptop bags have a heavy padded interior.  I guess it can't hurt but it's just more work. Bottom line, i only used the actual laptop shell so in the future,  i personally wouldn't need the set.[EOS]

Yes, it's still so pretty, but that's all I can do is look at it unless I turn it in to a pin. The ear wrap cuff is too heavy to stay in place and it's too short to reach from the piercing to the top of your ear. You can't even get the outer edge of your ear through it to make it stay on without hurting yourself!

Well, I wasn't watching exactly, I was checking to see if it worked and it did.<br /><br />I also checked out Hulu and was kind of bummed that regular Hulu wasn't included. You have to subscribe to Hulu Plus, which I guess I'm going to have to break down and do. Crackle, however, is still all free. Plus there are a lot of other channels I'll never watch, especially the news ones, because I have basic cable which gives me CNN, Fox and MSNBC, so I'm not really interested in the various news shows that are rerun.<br /><br />Netflix and Hulu on my five-year-old TV though, those are the main reasons I got Roku and it's delivering them to me in spades. Five big stars because this is just a wonderful device.[EOS]

Case also seems to make the Phone easier to handle as well, and feels comfortable to hold for extended periods of time.

[BOS]I have some rental properties.[SEP]I would definite recommend it to my friends.[SEP]I have some rental properties. When a property is vacant, I take care<br /><br />of the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.<br /><br />One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.<br /><br />I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.<br /><br />Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.<br /><br />This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.<br /><br />Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.<br /><br />One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.<br /><br />Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down.When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.<br /><br />All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends.[EOS]

The instructions do seem complicated but if you take the time to look at the pictographs you'll be fine.<br /><br />Basically adhere the protector to your device, grab the protruding end on the right, slowly pull away towards the right, remove air bubbles with the cheap cardboard &#34;tool&#34; they give you (or a credit card), peel off the secondary layer and remove any excess bubbles.<br /><br />If you take the time to make sure everything's dust free you won't regret this purchase.

Only one thing easier: ease of use. I have a small basement apartment with stairs that lead up to the owner's apartment. As these stairs are never used, I placed the base legs of the stand on one of the wider bottom steps and leaned it against the wall. The top bar that leans against the wall has a soft rubber/plastic cushioning pad - so it makes no marks on the wall. Also with stand leaning out away from the wall and hooks straight out - my bike's handlebars never touch the wall. Unless you hang a motorcycle from the hooks - they're not going to slip down. Excellent design! Great value! You will not be disappointed.[EOS]

[BOS]I have thick hair that gets in the tub/shower drain, gets stuck in the pipe, and clogs it up.[SEP]You can also clean them in the dishwasher, or soak them in water and a little bleach if you like.[SEP]I have thick hair that gets in the tub/shower drain, gets stuck in the pipe, and clogs it up. These don't catch all the hair, but they do reduce the volume of hair that gets down the drain. When the drain slows from accumulated hair, I pour white vinegar and baking soda down the drain, wait 15 minutes, run hot water down the drain, and then I use a plunger on top of the drain to create a vacuum and push any leftover clog around the pipe bend, so there's no more obstruction and the tub drains fast.. Between these drain protectors and that cleaning method, I don't have to clean the drain often and I don't have to use toxic products. And at the cheap price for these (and they're  biodegradable), I can replace them when they get more built-up soap scum than I like. You can also clean them in the dishwasher, or soak them in water and a little bleach if you like.[EOS]

[BOS][[VIDEOID:e69353dba5885c9c0230bbd179014b6f]]This us a clip light with 4 settings, the light it produces is not very bright.[SEP]Ali Julia review[SEP][[VIDEOID:e69353dba5885c9c0230bbd179014b6f]]This us a clip light with 4 settings, the light it produces is not very bright.  I used a lux meter to help demonstrate the brightness of the light:    white light / bright setting = 344 lux  white light / low light setting = 162 lux    warm light / bright setting = 104 lux  warm light / low light setting = 66 lux    For comparison,  a 60 watt fluorescent light at the same distance is 1701 lux    The clip of this light is quite large, it is not something you would clip to the book as it would cover too much of the page. I found the clip a little stiff stiff and difficult to open, hopefully it will get easier as I use it.  I am using it clipped to a shelf.  My favorite feature is a nice switch on the cord that allows me to control the four light modes.  The neck is flexible and holds its position well.  It comes with a cord and USB adapter.    This clip light is provided by Mudder.    Ali Julia review[EOS]

[BOS]These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.[SEP]vote/gp/product/B00V3L7WME[SEP]These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00E9262IE  But they are the best I've heard in the sub $100 price range. Possibly comparable to these Sennheisers Earbuds http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B001EZYMF4  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00V3L7WME  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00V3L7WME[EOS]

[BOS]We bought this for our outdoor plants before we disappeared for a week to a vacation.[SEP]Out of our experience, we can highly recommend this product.[SEP]We bought this for our outdoor plants before we disappeared for a week to a vacation. At that time, weather here was dry and hot and no rain was forecast for the whole week, so we needed to provide the plants with some water.<br />The watering system worked as it should - when we came back, the plants were alive and looked rather well.<br />Set-up of the system is very easy, but due to the limited length of the water hose, you either need to compile your plants within the reach of this unit, or you have to buy more than one unit.<br />Our plants that needed the week long water treatment are all moveable, so we clustered them in an area of approximately 5 by 5 feet directly adjacent to the solar unit, which we attached to a rain pipe with the provided plastic bands.<br />Of course, being solar powered, it is paramount that the unit has access to sunlight, but in pour case this was only true for maybe four hours a day in the afternoon. Still, this and the rechargeable batteries you need to put in (not provided!) kept the unit going.<br />Another consideration is the flow rate of the water, which can be chosen variably. But the more water you let flow through the system, the bigger your tank has to be. Not everybody has a 50 gallon drum readily available, and we eventually had to settle for an old 20 gallon plastic container. we set the flow rate to a very low level and calculated that this would do the trick. It did. When we came back, the container was only half empty and our precious hibiscus and the other plants were in great shape.<br />So, this is certainly not a 1-2-3 solution - it needs a bit planning and preparation with placement, water supply and flow rate, but once you have figured it all out, it works perfectly.<br />We did not bother to remove the system after we got back from our vacation, but left it - and the plants -  in place. It just looked good the way the plants were arranged - though more out of necessity than of aesthetic reasons at first - andthe solar powered unit, after over one month of constant use, still supplies them with a steady stream of water.<br />Out of our experience, we can highly recommend this product.[EOS]

After heating the water I followed the directions and pumped up the tank to build internal pressure.  Once this was done the shower head/hose supplied an excellent flow ofwater with which to shower with.  This thing worked fantastic, I love it.

I was wrong.  This film is so much more than that as it &#34;tugged the strings&#34; and hit close to home as it would with millions of people around the world affected both directly and indirectly by illness.  However, by the end of the movie, I found that my melancholy emotions (as I have been affected, although indirectly, stricken with the same illness protagonist Jack is battling) were dwarfed by this films sense of adventure.  There is an intangible about this film that just makes me want to re-live my younger years as a Yankee fan and have the same strong aspirations as Jack.  This is a great film, for kids and adults alike, that teaches the invaluable lesson that know matter what hardships arise, with the right people by your side, you can choose to have the strength that makes you overcome.  One thing this movie lacked was more of my own personal favorite Yankees.  All in all, the message in this film was clear.[EOS]

[BOS]In the past, I have always dreaded applying screen protectors to my smartphones.[SEP]I would highly recommend this brand to anyone looking for a quality screen protector![SEP]In the past, I have always dreaded applying screen protectors to my smartphones.  I have always found them so hard to apply and find that after the application, I usually have air pockets, or didn't align in correctly.  Tech Armor has put those worries to rest!  I opened the package to find that the directions were clear and very easy to follow.  Still, I decided to go to YouTube to watch a video of how to apply it, which made the process dummy proof!  I went into the bathroom and turned on a hot shower to get steam into the air to prevent dust from floating around.  I cleaned the screen with the alcohol pad provided and wiped it down with the included microfiber cloth which made my screen spotless! Tech Armor was also kind enough to include to strips of dust removal tape to get any little pieces I might have missed.  The suction cup is what made this so easy to apply!  It prevents you from accidentally touching the adhesive side of the protector and the fact that you align it up with the home button makes it nearly impossible to align it up incorrectly.  Once I applied it and did the finger swipes, you can see the protector applying!  THIS IS THE FIRST screen protector I've ever had where I have absolutely no air bubbles at all!  I am beyond thrilled with this product!  The icing on the cake is that when I swipe my finger across the screen, it glides so easily that it doesn't even feel like I have a screen protector on!  This product it's first rate from the packaging to the instructions!  The fact that they include a home button sticker to raise it above the protector tells you this product was highly thought out.  It's dummy proof to install and well worth every cent!  I would highly recommend this brand to anyone looking for a quality screen protector![EOS]

I owned Turtle Beaches before with my Xbox 360 and decided to be a returning customer.<br /><br />My old headset was comfortable and worked well, I loved the bass you could hear with them.<br /><br />When I tried these I was definitely unhappy... The speakers would make an unbearable noise that sounded like rattling most of the time, even at lower volumes. If this wasn't bad enough, one speaker kept cutting out. I had to bang on the side to get it to start working again.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't enjoy these and can't imagine why they are charging so much for them.<br /><br />After this depressing experience I did some serious research and found a headset I absolutely LOVE.<br /><br />It's been over a month and I can't find anything to complain about. The sound and bass is great and I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort.<br /><br />I got them on Amazon actually -------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qwkjUH<br /><br />Even if they aren't the ones for you, I hope I could help share my story with this pair.[EOS]

[BOS]An excellent examination of one of society's pressing problems.[SEP]Highly recommended for anyone concerned about the future of our society.[SEP]An excellent examination of one of society's pressing problems...and of the Catch 22 we impose on those who have spent time in prison.<br /><br />Thankfully, this issue is gaining traction at the local level across the country, and there seems to be a growing recognition of the impracticality (as well as inhumanity) of imposing a life sentence on those who have paid for their crimes.<br /><br />The documentary is a powerful amalgam of personal stories and factual information, and makes its case in a reasoned way.

[BOS]I'll be honest -- I really didn't expect much out of these mics.[SEP]I would definitely buy again.[SEP]I'll be honest -- I really didn't expect much out of these mics.  I mean, c'mon -- I pay hundreds of dollars for a singe wireless mic from a reputable company.  At $80 for a pair, what do you expect?  But, on the whole, I'm really pleased.  I anticipated them only being good enough to use for public address, but I have recently even been using them for vocals.  They aren't as good as a quality wired mic, but they hold their own.  They are very cardioid, so you have to stay right on them to be heard.  This is not so good if you want to pick up a group of people on one mic, but it really helps eliminate feedback and background noise.  The base unit is particularly nice, with both 1/4&#34; and XLR balanced outputs, signal level meters and sound level meters, both for each mic.  I would definitely buy again.[EOS]

[BOS]In order to not void the warranty, you are required to install a filter between your water source and the pump, I elected to buy the Shurflo 1/2&#34; twist on pipe Strainer from the same vendor.[SEP]With the system all set up and running, I have better water pressure in my primitive abode than I used to have in a normal house.[SEP]In order to not void the warranty, you are required to install a filter between your water source and the pump, I elected to buy the Shurflo 1/2&#34; twist on pipe Strainer from the same vendor. For the price, this pump does exactly what it's supposed to do. I set up a domestic water system in my cottage. I collect rain water in a large 87 gallon rain barrel, then pump it through a couple of filters into a second barrel. When setting this up and testing, there was a shortage of rain (naturally!) so I filled it with a home garden hose. As the first tank filled, I activated the pump to send this water through the filters into the second tank. I was shocked to find that the regular house water system could not keep up with flow generated by the Flojet! With the system all set up and running, I have better water pressure in my primitive abode than I used to have in a normal house.[EOS]

[BOS]This necklace is very pretty with a very nice chain.[SEP]They deserve 5 stars with quality service![SEP]This necklace is very pretty with a very nice chain.  We bought this for our adult daughter who had mentioned she wanted what I thought was just another trendy piece of jewelry. After looking at many &#34;heartbeat&#34; necklaces, I chose this one because being 14carat gold, I thought it might be more durable. I was right- this one  is a very pretty piece of jewelry and my daughter was very pleased.  But just as important, Claddagh Gold Company was available via email throughout the shipping and delivery process! They responded immediately to all my inquiries! There were some issues with the Postal Service in getting this delivered to my daughter but Claddagh Gold was there with sincere assurance they would make this right! And they did!  I certainly recommend Claddagh Gold! They deserve 5 stars with quality service![EOS]
[BOS]There is no doubt that this tea works wonders for increasing milk production.[SEP]I personally prefer the capsules anyways since I was not crazy about the flavor of this tea anyways.[SEP]There is no doubt that this tea works wonders for increasing milk production. Within two days of drinking it 4-5 times a day I had more than enough milk. Actually my milk supply doubled! I am not a tea drinker so to me the taste is not very good. However increasing my milk supply is of course more important than the taste of the tea so if it didn't cause a terrible case of gas in my daughter than I would not have anything negative to say about it. But it made her so gassy that she did not sleep for almost an entire day.<br /><br />I suggest others to start with one or two bags per day to see if it has any negative side effects on your baby. I know it doesn't happen to everyone, I'm just one of the lucky one's I guess.<br /><br />I have since switched to taking fenugreek and blessed thistle capsules and I am again producing more milk than ever without any of the side effects the tea gave my daughter -[[ASIN:B00AAQIP5G Nature's Way Blessed Thistle (390mg) 100 Capsules + FREE Fenugreek (610mg) 100 Capsules]]. So, whatever it was that caused the gas in my baby, it doesn't appear to be the fenugreek or blessed thistle. I personally prefer the capsules anyways since I was not crazy about the flavor of this tea anyways.[EOS]

[BOS]This is absolutely PERFECT for exactly what I wanted.[SEP]The colorful liners DO come with the system.[SEP]This is absolutely PERFECT for exactly what I wanted. In my very small space I don't have room for a file cabinet. I wanted a wall system to file my active project folders, and happy colors to brighten up the space. At the same time, it is relatively flat against the wall/roof so it doesn't crowd my desk space or my elbow. It is easy to access the folders and return them to their resting place, so it keeps my desk clear and my visual space (and mind) uncluttered. Then I can collect it into a compact package so I can carry it to a better heated space when the weather is so cold it gets too drafty in my attic office. Did I mention that my attic walls are slanted? The folders don't fall out. The material is a poly type, so someday I expect that the corners might get brittle an crack a little, but I imagine by then I will be ready for a bit of decorative change--I figure that's what washi tape is for. The colorful liners DO come with the system.[EOS]

[BOS]I bought my first set of AX-180s several months back.[SEP]I would really like to know if anyone else was having problems with these headsets as well.[SEP]I bought my first set of AX-180s several months back. I decided to purchase the 2 year warranty for the headset, and boy am I glad I did! After hooking them up, I was pleased to be experiencing enhanced audio for my online gaming for the first time. For a 50 dollar headset, I wasn't expecting the greatest quality, but in fact, they definitely surpassed my expectations. Unfortunately, after a little over a month of use, I began having issues with the voice output on my microphone. It started with that loud blood curdling screech that only my friends could hear, following shortly after with a complete loss of voice communication on my end. Now, I understand that this happens with headsets... but that happens OVER TIME! I took the headset back to have them replaced. The second pair was much more polished (and by polished, I simply mean there were small details I noticed about this pair, that the older pair didn't have) and lasted longer... about 5 months longer. Until the same thing began to happen again (I started to see a trend), but this time, the whole left speaker went out. I was able to narrow it down to a connection issue with the left connector that hooked into the module. I decided that that was the last straw. I took them back again and upgraded to the AX-720s. I really hope that I am not just cursed when it comes to the 180s, but I really do find the 720s much better as far as performance goes. The 180s are a great headset. However, to me, you just can't really stop those small electrical malfunctions unless you're educated on fixing those problems. I hope this review was helpful. I would really like to know if anyone else was having problems with these headsets as well.[EOS]

Admittedly, a five-star rating might seem extravagant given the uneven quality of the stories but I could feel the love, so to speak.

[BOS]My family loves Yahtzee so in theory this would be a natural fit for us.[SEP]I'm sure we'll still bust this set out on occasion but over the holidays, with many family members around we only played a few rounds before switching to something else.[SEP]My family loves Yahtzee so in theory this would be a natural fit for us. In practice that's only partially true. While this is a fun game (and the deck of cards on dice gimmick is actually pretty cool) it's not quite as fun as Yahtzee just because it feels a lot less strategic. Now obviously I know there's a ton of luck involved in Yahtzee but at least that game gives you the ILLUSION of being strategic by deciding where you want to place your roll and what you want to go for. This game gives you a hand and then you have to try to match it - that's just straight-up luck. Not that a game of luck isn't fun, it's just not quite as much fun as another, existing game of luck involving dice. So while this game is slightly innovative and easy to carry around (and also very easy to learn), it's just not enough of an innovation to be worth switching from an existing and already beloved game. I'm sure we'll still bust this set out on occasion but over the holidays, with many family members around we only played a few rounds before switching to something else.[EOS]

I've used it twice a day on my face and back for the last month and even from after a couple of days use my skin immediately started clearing up and just kept getting better. I use it with a gentle organic cleanser and my skin is almost flawless. What imperfections still come is a shadow of what i used to get and disappear almost without notice. I would HIGHLY recommend this product, total game changer[EOS]

[BOS]This is a really nice mortar and pestle for grinding up vitamin tablets for my dogs.[SEP]nancy morse[SEP]This is a really nice mortar and pestle for grinding up vitamin tablets for my dogs.

Slick.<br /><br />Thanks for a wonderful product that pulverizes the pills to make them easily soluble.<br />Beautiful little item.<br /><br />nancy morse[EOS]
[BOS]We really liked this.[SEP]Of course, if you feel it's a risk, don't use it at all.[SEP]We really liked this.  We eventually had to take it out of the crib, around 12 months because my daughter would play with it and not sleep.  She quickly figured out how to turn it on and off.  I have no idea why it has a remote, we never used it until my kid figured it out and enjoyed it.  Eventually we strapped it on the back of a dining room chair and she played with it until about 20 months, when I decided I couldn't bear to hear the music anymore and finally took it down.  She loved turning it on and dancing to the music. She was far less interested in the moving parts.  I can't find the remote now, so good thing we never used it.  I'm going to pass it on to another family who can listen to the same songs OVER AND OVER.  I've seen the complaints about the strap.  I had the same issue too and thought it was defective, but I figured out how to adjust the back of the toy so it fit around the crib rail appropriately and then tighten it.  I can't tell you exactly what I did that fixed it, but once I got it situated correctly I had no problems with it easily coming undone.  So before giving up, trying moving things up and down and changing how it sits, you may find it just needed some adjustment.  Of course, if you feel it's a risk, don't use it at all.[EOS]

If you want a practice set for jammin out and having fun doing it this is probably a good choice.  I play guitar a little and wanted to try my hand at the drums. I looked at a used set of drums costing 450 at Guitar Center; this was better as it was new and cost less.   As a starter set the kit is perfectly fine and works they way it should.

[BOS]Very large and hard to handle in the front seat.[SEP]The two downsides to this shield are; 1) The top side gets very hot after being in the sun for a while, making it hard to roll up and 2) the screen itself is very wide due to the small side windows, resulting in a screen that needs to be coiled tightly to allow the velcro to hold it closed.[SEP]Very large and hard to handle in the front seat. It also moves the rear view mirror, so it needs to be adjusted after every use.<br /><br />However, living in Phoenix means dealing with 115+ degree days and my car is outside during the work day and when shopping. The large size means over 95% of the windscreen, plus the small side windows is covered when used. The highly reflective top side of the shield reflects most of the sun's heat and the almost white bottom reduces radiant energy transmission to keep your car cooler.<br /><br />The shield is fairly stiff, so it remains in place well being held just by the shades. This really helps keep the black dash board in the Prius cooler.<br /><br />This results in a significantly cooler interior temperature (I haven't measured it, but it's obvious when opening the car).<br /><br />The two downsides to this shield are; 1) The top side gets very hot after being in the sun for a while, making it hard to roll up and 2) the screen itself is very wide due to the small side windows, resulting in a screen that needs to be coiled tightly to allow the velcro to hold it closed.[EOS]

[BOS]This is the second pair of these for my daughter, who just turned two.[SEP]Hope that helps![SEP]This is the second pair of these for my daughter, who just turned two. In other shoes she is wearing a size 7, but in these she is wearing a 6. Amazon's exchange policy made the switch suuuuuper easy, but I wish I knew the sizing was off before I ordered in the first place. These will fit tight when they arrive, as they are meant to stretch and conform to your foot. After weeks of wear, these still look great. My favorite feature of these is that they are meant to get wet and stretch, whereas other leather shoes I am afraid of doing so. Literally take these to the beach to play in the sand and they will come out just as they went in!<br /><br />**Side note: I also wear these. The sizing is kinda the opposite for adults though. I am typically a 9.5 and I wear a size 10. Hope that helps![EOS]

I wear mine a few times a week and being in healthcare, wash my hands a lot and sometimes get water on the bracelet but have not had any issues with tarnishing or crystals falling out. Not bad at all for the price![EOS]

[BOS]What's not to love about Bulbrite's LED A19 bulb?[SEP]Overall, I still like using LED for the energy savings and I would recommend the Bulbrite bulb if you are looking for an LED.[SEP]What's not to love about Bulbrite's LED A19 bulb?  LED's have come a long way in just the last few years and I've equipped my home with quite a few of them by this point.  The gains in energy efficiency have been well documented by this point and as of the summer of 2014, I've yet to have any of my 7-8 LED bulbs go out on me which isn't surprising since they are supposed to last for years.<br /><br />So what I'm looking for in good LED bulb at this point is the function of the dimmer capabilities and the warmth (aka temperature) of the bulb.  My biggest issue with LED's is that they can still be a bit harsh inside, even the warm white (2700K) bulbs.<br /><br />As far the dimmer capabilities go, this bulb is top notch...it dims quickly and is sensitive enough to work fairly well with my dimmer.  You do have to turn it on at least medium to activate the light but then it will go lower and dimmer than most of my other LED bulbs.  Regarding temperature, I've found that all 2700K bulbs are not created equal.  This one is warmer and softer than other 27K LED's that I have, but they haven't gotten it as warm as I would like in an ideal situation.  Overall, I still like using LED for the energy savings and I would recommend the Bulbrite bulb if you are looking for an LED.[EOS]
[BOS][[VIDEOID:mo50IUXTKLVFPI]]Okay so had this wheel for a couple weeks.[SEP]Don't know if i'm doing something wrong but either way doesnt attach anymore and i'm very disappointed.[SEP][[VIDEOID:mo50IUXTKLVFPI]]Okay so had this wheel for a couple weeks. Bottom line is its plastic so you hear the spinning whapping sound, the pitter patter of their feet and the most annoying is it wobbles making a banging noise because there's a great deal of space between the cage and the actual wheel. Note that's in the large version. When my girls take off in full gallop the wobbling wheel bangs on the backside of the cage its unbearable. So 4am when i couldn't take it anymore i walked to the kitchen grabbed some pam and sprayed the wheel and realized i attached it upside down initially so that decreased all the noise by like 50% but, i have to say im disappointed by the product and i can sleep with some slight noise. The other members of the house actually was told get up walk over to close my bedroom door at night due to the noise. Then the urine collects in it i have to wipe it down and when it came in the package there was three sharp areas on the outside of the wheel that i had to buff down with a nail filer because im sure my girls could cut themselves. My metal grid wheel lubricated was completely silent to the point that i thought they stopped using the wheel but, they haven't. I got this one because of the danger of owning a mesh wheel. Have to say if it wasn't for their safety i wouldn't order this one. An another note my girls love it. They go nuts over this thing full speed full gallop. I have two rats and only one used to use a wheel now they both go crazy in this thing. I guess 5 stars from rats. Meh three stars for me.<br /><br />Update: Returning it! ugh so bad I'm so upset. Went to wipe it down and the wheel fell right of the wall of the cage! I didn't even put that much pressure worst of all the piece that secure the wheel to the cage was still attached to the cage!! WHAT THE HECK there a mid black plastic clip that clips to the wheel and then snap clips to the other piece that secures the wheel to the cage! I'm sorry but that just makes no sense and totally unsafe. Really whats the purpose of securing the wheel to the cage if it just snaps on to the securing piece with little tiny shallow hook to hole plastic snap mechanism. Which doesn't even hold no matter how hard i click it in. while i tried to attach it to the cage the wheel falls off the clip. I think one of the hooks is bent and doesn't snap tightly anymore. I don't understand if it was for the purpose of faster cleaning but i rather unscrew the cap of to release it and know that its tight and secure when i attach it. Doesn't take that much longer. Jeez One gallop and one of my rats would of flew off the wheel with the wheel along with her! Now it wont snap back on properly so even then i was willing to use the stupid stand nope its tilted and wobbles so much. Why is this thing so unstable?? This wheel is not worth 10$. Included a short video to show what i mean. Don't know if i'm doing something wrong but either way doesnt attach anymore and i'm very disappointed.[EOS]

[BOS]This mount is a beast and that's just what I needed for my huge display.[SEP]Great mount able to handle a large tv set with no problem.[SEP]This mount is a beast and that's just what I needed for my huge display. I have a 90 some pound 70 inch and this mount holds it like its nothing. Now the mount is heavy and big itself so I guess that can be a draw back, but it has to be if your trying to get it to hold screens of this size and weight. It was pretty easy to install with a friend I would not recommend doing it alone it is a two man job. Once the we had it up and got my heavy tv on it everything held and didn't budge. When it came to moving it one of the joints were a little stiff just enough to bug me, I was able to adjust the swivel tension screw and fixed it with ease. This mount moves with ease as I change up the direction my display is facing all depends on where I am sitting or at in my room. But I can see the screen from a prefect angle wherever I wanted to be. I really have nothing bad to say about this mount just something's I pointed out. like I said you will need someone to help you because its heavy but other than that its smooth sailing. make sure your screwed into your studs! Great mount able to handle a large tv set with no problem.[EOS]

[BOS]The kids in our lives.[SEP]They liked this little gizmo and had a lot of fun.[SEP]The kids in our lives... my grandson and his 2 best friends.. all at the ripe old age of 11 seem to be mesmerized with spy novels, spy movies, spy toys, spy games, spy everything.<br /><br />When we were kids we played outside with our imaginations...<br /><br />These kids play spy games and have spy parties for their birthdays and it seems its all they want to do… for now...<br />We decided to indulge them and got this spy pen for them to use. The first day we had 3 kids over and it is amazing to me (as a  non-techy person) how quickly they all seemed to know exactly how it works. They all thought it was just great and took turns being the &#34;spy&#34;.<br /><br />We are really happy the kids are so happy. Good job!<br /><br />engage it and see they are truly having fun. They liked this little gizmo and had a lot of fun.[EOS]

Be sure to ask where your matcha comes from before you buy.&#34;<br /><br />It's worth checking out the article!<br /><br />BTW, the author also said that: &#34;The Japanese tea leaves did not have any tea leaves that exceeded the limit.&#34;<br /><br />I think Japanese matcha is healthier.

[BOS]We have 4 dogs, two who love the squeeker toys and two who are afraid of them.[SEP]We have been supplying their ball habits for several years now with the Kong balls and will continue to do so as we get as much pleasure just watching them and their fun.[SEP]We have 4 dogs, two who love the squeeker toys and two who are afraid of them.  My review is for Min. Schnauzer who is 11 but acts like she's 6 mo. when presented with a "squeeker" and my male black lab who spends hours and hours just laying and squeeking.  The lab takes his ball everywhere he goes and in addition to a New Year's noise fest, he uses the ball to tell us when he wants out of his shed/pen in the mornings and 10 minutes before supper time.  I'll have to say that I agree with many of the reviews here in that the squeek doesn't last nearly as long as it should but he's now well past the stage of chewing up the entire ball so we do get a little milage out of it.  As he takes it everywhere with him, he tends to leave it in the most unusual places (rabbit scents come calling) on our 20 acres.  The bright yellow makes it much easier for us to locate. Our little Schnauzer likes the little balls and although she is quite a little squeeker, her big thing is playing throw and chase either with herself or with us. We have been supplying their ball habits for several years now with the Kong balls and will continue to do so as we get as much pleasure just watching them and their fun.[EOS]

My first try was less than perfect...I acted like a know-it-all and only glanced at the directions.    After reading the directions more carefully, the second try as better, and by the fourth try I was a pro, and you will be too.  The video shows my second try, so it's still a bit wonky.    Just keep in mind you can cut the sheet and select a small design that you don't mind messing up. You can use the whole design or just a part of one.  Save the ones you love for when you are the above mentioned pro.    Simply place on your skin, and press down with a slightly damp washcloth. Resist the urge to pull up the backing too soon. Slowly peel that backing off, and there you are! Don't wash or get it wet for at least an hour.  They really stay on, but when you want to take them off it's pretty easy. I used an alcohol pad followed with some coconut oil. I've used them on my ankles, neck, and the tops of my feet.    Can't wait for them to come up with more designs!

I used the ice for the first time this week and I was a little bit non-plussed by the length of time they lasted. I was using the ice inside, in a controlled-temperature environment and I can't say that I noticed they lasted any longer than say, a cube from an actual ice cube tray. However ... I still think they are worth it because the look much cooler than a cube! I am eager to try using filtered water to see if I can get crystal clear ice balls. The ball is about the size of a golf ball. I would like it to be a bit bigger (I am starting to giggle as I write this) so you could plop one in a rocks glass instead of two. However, this size also fits in tall, slim glasses. They're fun! If you're serving drinks or just enjoy a good sip of Scotch, you should have these.[EOS]

It was definitely different and something I would never read again or even recommend.<br /><br />I found myself just waiting for something big to happen and actually get the book going and then I looked down and realized I was two-thirds of the way done and nothing had happened, there was no plot. The main character, David, complained and complained and I wanted to throw the book at him. His girlfriend was equality annoying and the one time I was excited is when she finally discovered her backbone towards the end.<br /><br />Personally, I think it came down to the stylistic choices by the author that I couldn’t get behind. The writing is very spacey and clunky. Most of the story was pure dialogue. I missed the descriptive language and adjectives to make me feel like I’m in the book with the characters. I imagine this could be something you could adjust to but I couldn’t get my head around it, I felt like I was reading someone’s diary instead of a book.<br /><br />In the end it’s a very particular book that wasn’t too my liking, but maybe at 21 I’m just too optimistic about life and growing up to appreciate such “realism.”[EOS]

[BOS]The LED Bike light is certainly a bright idea.[SEP]I wouldn't ride my bike without it.[SEP]The LED Bike light is certainly a bright idea. The flashlight is one of the brightest I have ever seen. It requires 3 AAA batteries to operate. The flashlight is removable from the mount, so you can take it with you from your bike. That's important because this is a pretty awesome flashlight and you wouldn't want it stolen.<br /><br />The flashlight itself requires 3 AAA batteries. And certainly makes this a bright light. There are different magnification levels for how much &#34;spread&#34; you want or how &#34;directed&#34; you want your beam. The flahslight has a handle too so you can strap it in on your hand when it's portable.<br /><br />This is a nice light to have on your bike. I wouldn't ride my bike without it.[EOS]

I wish my friends had a Galaxy S4 so I can give them the 2 spare screen protectors that came in my package. I don't want them to go to waste because I'm pretty sure I won't need them. It's very durable and I still have no scratches on the phone. Pretty amazing.<br /><br />The package comes with 3 screen protectors, a chamois-like cloth to clean it with, dust stickers to pick up any lint on the screen protector before you place it on your phone, a credit card sized, thin cardboard piece so you can smooth out any stubborn bubbles underneath the protector and a set of easy to follow instructions (including a link to a simple, easy, I mean EASY to follow installation video).<br /><br />Buy this screen protector, that includes a lifetime warranty for what... like, 6 bucks?? A no brainer.<br />(Note: it's only for the Samsung Galaxy S4 (not the Active))[EOS]

[BOS]Yup just like the title says, I bought the H7 version for my wifes Milan and they are 10x's brighter then the H11.[SEP]I'm still happy with the H7 artic white bulbs and Top Options prices.[SEP]Yup just like the title says, I bought the H7 version for my wifes Milan and they are 10x's brighter then the H11. These were going into her foglight housings and the oem lit up more then these. On top of that, they didnt even fit in right. I had to trim the tabs on the lights to make them fit. I tried them on my father-in-laws Ford Fusion since both cars use the H11 for both headlight and foglight and even in the headlight they fell on there face. These are 80 watt bulbs and the oem 55 watt bulbs outperformed these. Yea the H7's and these are from the same maker but not all things are the same. Ive been doing lighting for the past 15 yrs from plug-n-play system to full custom hid retro-fits into cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Nokya brand bulbs are good but not all of them are worth it like the H11 bulb. If it wasn't for the fact that the foglight housing is smaller then the low beam housing, I would have done HID's instead. I'm still happy with the H7 artic white bulbs and Top Options prices.[EOS]

[BOS]First off, i purchased this camera through a local store and not through Amazon.[SEP]Save yourself the money.[SEP]First off, i purchased this camera through a local store and not through Amazon. First, you need a micro SD card for the camera to save anything. You also cannot connect the camera to the computer to view files, you must remove the SD card and put that into your computer each time. Also, on the installation disk included, the camera model (DVR 781 HD) is not even included in the selections which tells you something. Tested the camera a few times, it worked fine but a decent camera today can shoot better. Also, navigating the menus inside the camera is a hassle and only through constant practice will you be able to understand that, within the menus, the shutter butter is enter and the OK button is back. A little confusing to the average Joe.  Conclusion  The extra pieces (waterproof case, different mounts) can't make up for a camera that is now clearly outdated. Save yourself the money.[EOS]

[BOS]I have 3 dogs, enough said.[SEP]So, needless to say I am totally sold on this product.[SEP]I have 3 dogs, enough said. All of them are technically short hair but one is a retriever mix so there is a golden glow to the house. Having used brushes in the past, I thought I just had to live with this. When I received the Hair Hero I was impressed by its design-- it felt so good in my hand. I started right in on the retriever and wow! I could not believe the pile of fur it produced. Thunder looked like a different dog and he was dancing around, coming back for more. (???) Seeing this, the other 2 lined up for their turn. I wasn't expecting much from their coats, but again, a surprising amount of fur. Another surprise, they were so shiny. So, needless to say I am totally sold on this product.[EOS]

[BOS]Very dangerous dog sunscreen![SEP]Read the label carefully and I hope this helps you choose wisely.[SEP]Very dangerous dog sunscreen!!! I bought this for my hairless Chinese Crested dog and had to take him to the vet.  Do your homework about dog sunscreens because some have toxic ingredients like this one(Benzophenone-3) which can cause contact eczema & absorbs into the body and does not process out.  Zinc oxide is toxic for dogs.Harmful ingredients are triethanolamine, Imidura, Methyl Paraben, DMDM Hydantoin.  Titanium dioxide is a good ingredient but the SAFEST is organic sunscreens for babies containing sunflower/jojoba seed oils, green tea leaf extracts, calendula flower/gingko leaf extracts, aloe juice, vitamin E, with titanium dioxide.  I'm looking at some brands at a local Whole Foods store which should be good.  Read the label carefully and I hope this helps you choose wisely.[EOS]

This DVD is a complete and total utter piece of garbage! The choreography is off key and bad. She is very stiff and barely dancing other than a few poorly coordinated movements and the WORST OF ALL...she is LIP SYNCING!!!! This is totally unacceptable! I understand that Brit is one of those studio artists but I would have preferred to hear her voice a little unsteady or poorly controlled than the studio track over crappy choreography! I'm disappointed because I love Brit and her music since &#34;Bay One More Time&#34; and her comeback from the bipolar breakdown was commendable but this is not her standard whatsoever. I'll still buy her cd's because her music is very upbeat simple dancey pop. No ballads or deep moving music. Just fun upbeat dance clubbing with friends. The DVD was painful to watch. I couldn't even make it through the first set. I will be demanding my refund as well as all of us who wasted $15. It would be great if we could all file a class action lawsuit to demand a ban on the sale of this fraudulent p.o.s.[EOS]

[BOS]Houses need to be maintained and one area that is often neglected is outside cleaning.[SEP]It gets the job done and exceeds expectations on most all levels, making it an excellent choice for outdoor cleaning needs.[SEP]Houses need to be maintained and one area that is often neglected is outside cleaning. Most of us keep our grass cut and the shrubs trimmed, but we often overlook the outside of the house itself. This is where a power washer can help and a good tool for the task is the AR Blue Clean AR390SS Cold Water Electric Pressure Washer.<br /><br />I have used power washers in the past but I never had one to call my own until now. This one is better than the power washers I have experienced previously and probably the main difference is the power. This power washer delivers a whopping 2000 psi of dirt- busting power, easily enough to eliminate the grime and other buildup on the sides of your house or your driveway. I was actually a little worried about the level of power and wondered if it would be too much. This made me hesitate a little at first, but once I started to clean, my worries vanished, my confidence increased, and I continued to wash my siding at a fast pace. You can, of course, dial down the pressure a little, but the 2000 psi is fine for most uses and makes the task of cleaning the siding or driveway that much easier and faster.<br /><br />This power washer comes with several attachments like a turbo nozzle, pencil nozzle, fan spray nozzle, and detergent nozzle. These different tips are an improvement compared to the power washers I have used in the past. They allow you to select the right tool for the task, for the best overall cleaning. I haven’t used any detergent or cleaner yet and have used primarily the turbo nozzle since it delivers the strongest stream of water. But it’s nice to know that the other options are available when I need them.<br /><br />I like the reel on this power washer and I like the ease of storage. The power cord is fine for my house because I have outside electrical outlets on each side of my house. If your home has fewer, you may need an extension cord. Other than that, I can’t find many bad things at all to say about this powerwasher. It gets the job done and exceeds expectations on most all levels, making it an excellent choice for outdoor cleaning needs.[EOS]

[BOS]Although not very fashionable this harness works great![SEP])[SEP]Although not very fashionable this harness works great! We have a Boston Terrier mix that is about 30 pounds and he wears it all day since we take him out often. The adjustable strap also makes it much easier to put on and take off than other harnesses that we have had. Just throw both loops over their head, pass their legs through the rear loop and adjust the strap on their back. Takes 10 seconds or less if your dog is cooperative. I would love to see this harness in reflective colors too (maybe with a slightly thicker/wider rope material?)[EOS]

[BOS]These is a really good head unit.[SEP]They need to do some upgrading on that.[SEP]These is a really good head unit.  However, it does have some drawbacks.  First, anytime you hook up your phone (i have an iPhone) and you want to play the iPod, the unit will always start playing the first song in the alphabet.  Even if you turn your car off take the phone and come back to the car to start playing where you left off, it will again start at the first song in the alphabet.  That part annoys me.  Next the microphone for the bluetooth is not that great.  People have a hard time hearing me, and I like to do voice to text when I am driving.  With the bluetooth, it has no idea what I am saying, and therefore, has kinda made that feature useless.  The last issue I have, which may not be a big issue to some, is that when you turn the unit off, the LCD screen stays on.  It will say that it is off, but it is still lit up with the animation still going.  I also think that the apps that are useable by this head unit are too limited.  I only use one of the apps that it is compatible for.  They need to do some upgrading on that.[EOS]

Some parts had me laughing so hard I had tears roll down my face. This is the fifth book written by Ms. Handler (I have them all) and I absolutely love it. It's probably my favorite. I don't know how Ms. Handler gets herself into these situations but I'm glad it happens. I've also confirmed my theory that Ms. Handler and I would get along really well since I'm also half-Jewish, sarcastic and incredibly uncoordinated.... I can't wait for her next book!! I sincerely hope she continues to write books. Definitely recommend![EOS]

[BOS]A decent coffee maker with lots of room for improvement.[SEP]With some improvements it could be a great coffee maker.[SEP]A decent coffee maker with lots of room for improvement.  It does K-cups, one cups, or a pot, but none of them well.    Pros    1. Flexibility - you can brew coffee by all three methods.  2. Price - This is cheap for what it is. (As long as you can get it for less than 70)  3. Size - It's not too large for what it does.  4. Programmable - Unexpected bonus at this price range.    Cons    1. Horrific plastic smell and taste.  It takes forever to get rid of it.  I had to run five full pots of White Vinegar and water to get rid of it.    2. One cups are horribly messy and tons of grounds make it into your coffee.  3. K-Cups are on the slow side, but not too bad.  4. You can only put in the water you want to use at that moment.  You cannot fill the basin and brew whatever you want. If you want a k-cup, you have to measure out the water.    Overall this is an okay coffee maker.  With some improvements it could be a great coffee maker.[EOS]

I have weight lifting gloves but they are kind of awkward when I need to work on the computer – to highlight, copy, write reports.

[BOS]After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to purchase this peppermill to replace our ancient crank mill.[SEP]She replied that it was fine with them.[SEP]After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to purchase this peppermill to replace our ancient crank mill. But I wanted a white exterior, not the traditional black for pepper. We don't grind salt at our house so I don't need a white salt grinder.  Grinders for salt and pepper are made differently. Pepper grinders need a metal grinder for the harder peppercorns, while salt grinders can use other materials. The black and white color scheme obviously makes it easier to identify what you are about to grind, salt or pepper.  The ads on Amazon don't offer a white peppermill. But in a phone call to the manufacturer I learned that they are happy to put the pepper grinding mechanism into a white shell. At no extra charge!  I ordered the white mill on Thursday and the Post Office delivered it on Monday.  The thumbscrew on the bottom makes it easy to adjust the grind from fine powder to a coarse grind.  I feel no need to repeat the detailed comments from other reviewers that you've already read. I just wanted you to know that you can get the peppermill in white, if you so desire.  One more thing, I did ask the lady I spoke with whether or not it was okay to tell the world via Amazon that they would make it in white upon request. She replied that it was fine with them.[EOS]

[BOS]I needed a decent sized bottle to keep my olive oil in, since that's pretty much all we use for sautéing, baking, and in place of butter.[SEP]I expect to get lots of compliments on it and may end up ordering more of these![SEP]I needed a decent sized bottle to keep my olive oil in, since that's pretty much all we use for sautéing, baking, and in place of butter.  This one was a larger capacity.  I also needed something no wider than four inches at the base to fit on the shelf above my stove, this was perfect. Finally, I wanted something with very little detail, and definitely no vining grape leaves or other crap like that. I went with this one, even though I couldn't tell what the pattern on it was, solely because of the price and size.  I'm glad I did! The bottle is an octagon, just slightly tinted blue, and with the olive oil, it looks sea green.  The pattern repeats on each of the sides (it looks like a stylized half sun above an upright leaf), and it's is simple and classy, but not too ornate - yay!<br /><br />The bottle came with a decent looking cork that has an imbedded ring (so you can attach it to the bottle?), but I chose to fit a pour spout into it.  I expect to get lots of compliments on it and may end up ordering more of these![EOS]

[BOS]This Jack was complete garbage and a waste of money.[SEP]This is a lessons learned for me.[SEP]This Jack was complete garbage and a waste of money. The Jack lifted up but then slowly sunk back without any weight on it. While lifting up the Jack you could hear the sound of springs popping like it was going to explode. The same sound could be heard as it slowly sunk back down without any weight on it. Because of the cost of shipping it is not worth returning. My only option now is to get parts for it under the warranty and try to fix it. This is a very frustrating option for something new out of the box. This is the worst purchase I have ever made. Save your self the frustration and don't buy this product. You can easily find these Jacks locally from your corner auto parts store at the same price and you will have the recourse of returning it to the store if it doesn't work. This is a lessons learned for me.[EOS]

When I pulled the suitcase off of the baggage claim belt, it seemed to explode--the zipper broke, and all of my clothes were thrown out onto the floor of the airport.

[BOS]I've had the    http://fave.[SEP]co/1bQuUp5[SEP]I've had the    http://fave.co/1bQuUp5   for almost a month now and have used it everyday extensively. I give it a solid 5 stars because it admirably performs way above it's price range. A 28 inch LED HDTV at the $200 price level is an amazing accomplishment all on its own. -- The TV has its quirks, some which would cause it to lose a star or two if it was twice the price or more as other brands are for the same thing. And so complaints about the TV in other reviews here are comparable to reviewing a $10K new car and complaining that the power window motor isn't as smooth or powerful as in their $70K Mercedes, and that the engine isn't as smooth and powerful as a car several times its price - or the stereo isn't as fancy, etc. --- This TV is a $200 28 inch LED HDTV - so keep that in context and you'll be amazed by it. The only other TV I would possibly consider at this price point would be the    http://fave.co/1bQvjb5  The picture is absolutely perfect - high-def sharp - the colors are all perfect with no video distortions anywhere across the entire screen. The complaints about this TVs audio is really strange, because the audio is quite good - much better than I would expect for such a low priced TV. -- I suppose if you put this TV in a large living room - viewing it from 14 to 16 feet away, then the audio may not be perfect for that application.  The overall aesthetics of the TV are also quite impressive - very sleek with a thin black border frame, sitting on a wide stable stand that is one of the best designs for a TV stand I've ever seen - placing the TV low to surface it is sitting on - making it very secure on its feet - instead of the way its done on almost all other TVs; stupidly stuck up in the air on some spindly center pole.  The inputs on this TV are indeed limited. It doesn't have three or four of every input imaginable. Instead, it has two HDMI inputs, one component input, one VGA (RGB-PC) input for your computer, and a 75 ohm cable input. As far as which HDMI cables to use I recommend amazon's very own    http://fave.co/1bQuuPE  That's it, but if you need more than that, then you should be prepared and willing to spend a lot more than $200. --- I use my E280-B1 for both a TV and a computer monitor and I am very impressed with its performance as a computer monitor. A 28 inch dedicated computer monitor costs twice as much as this TV, yet this TV outperforms all the dedicated hi-def digital computer monitors I've had - very impressive indeed.  There are some quirks. The earphone audio output comes from the factory at a unusably low audio level, which is unaffected by the volume control. To make the earphone jack useful, you need to go into the Menu - choose &#34;Audio&#34; and then &#34;Analog Audio Out&#34; and change that setting from &#34;Fixed&#34; to &#34;Variable&#34; -- back out of the menu and your earphone jack in now useful and controlled by the TVs volume control. - And the remote control is much smaller than other remotes, so it takes some getting used to before it feels comfortable to use. The RC being small takes away space that could have been used to include the four main input selections as dedicated buttons - instead of having to go into &#34;Input&#34; each time and scroll to choose the one you want. Other than these quirks, the TV is most definitely as good as it gets - and much more - for a $200 TV.  It deserves 4.9 stars, but since there is no such rating, rounding to the nearest whole number gives it 5 stars. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone needing a hi-def TV for a small room or their office to be used as a TV and monitor - because you get way more than what you paid for.....  In the end I recommend the    http://fave.co/1bQuUp5[EOS]

The mattress was ready to use in 30 minutes after unpackaging even though the instructions said to allow 24 to 48 hours. It's amazing how much the mattress can be compressed for shipping.

[BOS]Its rare to find books that the whole family can pass around and read and enjoy on so many levels.[SEP]Great book, highly recommend for all ages![SEP]Its rare to find books that the whole family can pass around and read and enjoy on so many levels.  I loved how the stories are broken down in separate chapters so you can read a story at a time, as a devotion, or read several if time permits.  Each story made me feel inspired by God's 4 legged friends, and inspired by the human's who benefited from them.  There are lessons in every chapter of this book!  I was able to share this book with my husband, son and daughter (both teens) and everyone enjoyed it and found time to talk about specific dogs and what they did for their owners, it made excellent dinner table conversation!  We could glance down and wonder if our own pet would step up and &#34;come to the rescue&#34; if we needed him to!  Great book, highly recommend for all ages![EOS]

[BOS]I can't think of anything more fun as a young boy than driving around in a Jeep of my own and if my nephews' reaction to the Fisher-Price Hot Wheels Jeep Wrangler is any indication, they agree.[SEP]They will love it![SEP]I can't think of anything more fun as a young boy than driving around in a Jeep of my own and if my nephews' reaction to the Fisher-Price Hot Wheels Jeep Wrangler is any indication, they agree. They LOVE (and I mean absolutely without a doubt love) this Jeep more than anything else they have ever played with!<br /><br />The 6-year-old actually helped put it together (the directions were very easy to follow!) though I suggest using a power screw driver. That would have made the assembly much quicker- there are tons of screws used to put it together! It's helpful to have two people to put it together but not absolutely necessary. This is something to consider if you're planning on assembling this Christmas Eve.<br /><br />The 6-year-old is a tall 49&#34; but has no problem fitting in the jeep and he learned very quickly how to switch gears between fast, slow and reverse. His brothers (4 and 2) take turns riding as passengers. The middle one can drive it but he's not as confident and savvy as his older brother so he hasn't done much driving yet- he's content to just ride.<br /><br />The charging process isn't bad at all. You leave the battery in the jeep and unplug the Jeep's power plug and then attach the wall charger plug with the battery still in the jeep. Makes it very easy. We just leave it in the garage and plug it in after every use like they suggest. It runs out of juice after about 1 1/2 -2 hours of constant high-speed driving. I'm actually happy that it requires charging time though or the boys would never want to do anything else.<br /><br />There's a little battery powered radio that plays music with real buttons to push. My little boys love that feature, especially as passengers. It requires AA batteries that aren't included.<br /><br />The Jeep maneuvers very well on the sidewalks and on concrete. It has to work a little harder going through grass but still works okay going up small hills around our neighborhood. One drawback is that it is pretty loud andas the boys want to get out and play as soon as they wake up in the morning I worry that they're waking my neighbors up. No complaints yet though!<br /><br />After about 3 weeks of daily riding it is still in great shape! With 3 boys that is a huge positive in my book and kind of surprising. It's very sturdy and well made.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this Jeep to anyone with kids. They will love it![EOS]

[BOS]First of all, let me admit that I didn't necessarily need a region-free player.[SEP]Bravo, Pioneer![SEP]First of all, let me admit that I didn't necessarily need a region-free player.  What I DID need was a reliable DVD player that could upconvert my extensive DVD collection to 1080p, and do it WELL!  This player did not disappoint me.  My DVD's now look absolutely gorgeous through this player, and that's important to me because my DVD collection is quite extensive and I'm not willing to replace them all with blu-ray versions (and of course some of my favorite DVD's aren't even available on blu-ray yet.)  So if you're like me and all you need is a good solid player with stellar upconversion, this is the player for you!  Bravo, Pioneer![EOS]

[BOS]I could jump up and down and scream----I have FINALLY found something that eliminates odor.[SEP]Good thing I have Fizzion in case that happens![SEP]I could jump up and down and scream----I have FINALLY found something that eliminates odor. Yes, you heard me ELIMINATES it. It's gone, gone, no more smell. I have tried everything out there. Sprays, vinegar, you name it, I have tried it (my cat is a repeat offender). So when I watched "My Cat From Hell", and Jackson recommended this, I thought "what do I have to lose". If I could give this 10 stars, I would!<br /><br />I didn't honestly believe this would eliminate it, as I have tried every so-called eliminator, and nothing has worked. I used it on 3 spots, 2 of which were minor and one that was bad. My cat got a urinary infection, so she peed on the floor. The urine was a stronger smell than usual because of her infection. The 2 spots were probably only 1 time offenses, but the stronger spot was most likely several repeat urinations in that same area. I tried 2 different products on all spots, and the smell still lingered. The bad spot was still very strong. I then tried this exactly as the directions say, and the 2 minor spots are gone, completely gone. The bad spot took several treatments. I have a [[ASIN:B0016HF5GK BISSELL Little Green Multi-Purpose Compact Deep Cleaner, 1400-7]], so I saturated the area with the cleaner in the spray bottle and let is set for about 30 minutes. I then sucked the cleaner up with my Bissell, and repeated the process. The smell was gone in the entire strip of carpet, except for a lingering of it in one small area. You have to get down into the carpet with your nose to smell the lingering scent. I believe that with continued treatment, I can eliminate the entire odor completely.<br /><br />I will be buying a bulk pack of these things from now on. I'm so excited I might wet myself! Good thing I have Fizzion in case that happens![EOS]

[BOS]Calphalon LX Series knives feature traditional German style blades with thick spines, hefty weight, forged full tang construction.[SEP]They have been offered at substantial savings in off-price stores.[SEP]Calphalon LX Series knives feature traditional German style blades with thick spines, hefty weight, forged full tang construction.  This chef's knife has a highly curved cutting edge that facilitates mincing by rocking the blade between the heel and point.  Recommendation:  Before buying, remove the knife from the box and see if its weight and balance match your preferences.  The blade is labeled &#34;GERMAN STEEL MADE IN CHINA.&#34;  Calphalon customer support advised that both the steel and the knife were made in China, but declined to identify the alloy. In my sample, the blade was sharp out of the box. The edge quality is easily maintained with a few strokes on a sharpening steel. The alloy is not a super-hard exotic steel, but holds its edge well enough in practical use. Hand wash and dry promptly after using.  Manufacturer offers lifetime warranty after user registration.  The LX Series knives have been discontinued.  They have been offered at substantial savings in off-price stores.[EOS]

The visibility is very good for outdoor usage while it is not as good when used indoor, and this is why I gave it 4 stars. Over all, they are well made where they protect the eyes perfectly.

I put it on to see how comfortable it was to wear under my jeans and forgot that I was wearing it until I got ready for bed. The fabric has a nice feel, unlike others I have used before. It would also be the perfect gift to give someone who is a first time traveler. I take groups of students to Europe and always require them to wear a money belt. This one is great as you forget you are wearing it until you need something out of it. I like the fact it has two zippered sections as well. It also has an adjustable strap so it should fit most sizes. The strap feels solid and should hold nicely and not stretch out as the less expensive ones I have used previously do.[EOS]

It is also getting more and more expensive. Not too long ago it was a $20 watch and quickly jumped up to a $50 watch. For how quickly it wears out, I think the price is way too high!

I picked this up for a bargain, and my Leatherman Kick fits perfectly.  I've also gotten to test out and confirm a good fit for Leatherman's Fuse, Wingman, Pulse and Rebar multitools as well.  The Leatherman Sidekick fit, though it had a little wiggle room, so it might benefit for a smaller holster.  Every aspect of the sheath is quality - from materials to construction.

A bit on the pricey side for a tumbler.<br />- Size. Due to it's size (girth) it does not fit well or at all in some vehicle cupholders.<br /><br />~TIPS~<br />- Do not let colored drinks to sit in the tumbler for too long.

[BOS]Unless you have a cabinet saw or a panel saw, it can be difficult to make accurate cuts on plywood sheets.[SEP]It's an excellent value.[SEP]Unless you have a cabinet saw or a panel saw, it can be difficult to make accurate cuts on plywood sheets.  I've tried several jigs, commercial and homemade, none of which have been entirely satisfactory. The Kreg I bought most recently has a very complicated setup, will only cut a foot from the edge, and once set up, you can't swap saws. It wouldn't fit my Porter-Cable trim saw, either. The best jigs are those in which the saw is locked to the track, and can't wander to either side. Most I've seen require a dedicated saw and track, like the DeWalt and the Festool, which run $600 and up. Way up.<br /><br />So here's this inexpensive saw guide that's adaptable to just about any saw, can be attached in minutes, and can be adjusted to fit any rail or reasonable thick straight edge up to 3-1/2&#34; wide, and it costs a faction of the other guides. I mounted my Porter-Cable, clamped my cheap straight edge on a leftover piece of 1/2&#34; ply,  adjusted the plate to fit my straightedge, and did a test cut. Result: No wandering, and a near perfect cut.<br /><br />I've been having my neighborhood lumberyard do my plywood cutting for me, which they do happily and accurately, but the general purpose blade they have mounted on their table saw doesn't leave the cleanest edge. Fine for construction, not so much for cabinetry.  I can make much better finish cuts at home now, using this jig, a pair of sawhorses, and a specialized plywood cutting blade. It's an excellent value.[EOS]

If you haven't already looked at this you should: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWK09Q?tag=i60-20  I originally got this for my mom because she has some heart issues, after years of high blood pressure and diabetes. It will go only as fast as you pedal so she likes how she can take it slow while watching tv, to improve circulation in her legs.  However, if you are a young healthy person looking for a cardio workout in confined space / on the cheap, this is also very effective. Although of course not as effective at burning calories as running outside, if this is what you have to work with, it's doable.  As a note, if you are using this for serious cardio (30+ minutes), I highly suggest buying some ankle weights (3-5 lbs per leg) and wearing them while you pedal - it makes it around twice as hard and is very effective. I bought some weights on amazon with the free shipping option for less than ten dollars.[EOS]

Bought the cord to charge my controller for my PS4 while playing, and it displays a ? when charging, so you have no idea when to unplug it. It's loose going into the controller, and after 2 days of only several hours of playing, the part that plugs into the controller became weak, and fell off.

[BOS]I cut the handle off mine, it being to long and just got in my way.[SEP]Otherwise, this brush does a good job cleaning up a wok post haste.[SEP]I cut the handle off mine, it being to long and just got in my way.  I like the width of the head, it's a perfect size for my hand to grip.  The major down for this brush are the bristles.  They are kept in place by the friction of the bristles in their mounting holes.  I would have preferred they be secured by some form of glue.  As you use the brush the bristles will gradually come out of their mounting holes.  I've been gradually plucking out the loose bristles as I've been using it.  I doubt it'll last the year at the rate the bristles are falling out.  I'll probably take action and use a hot epoxy to flow across the head, or perhaps some super glue to set the bristles.  Otherwise, this brush does a good job cleaning up a wok post haste.[EOS]

[BOS]People wanted a total piece of garbage?[SEP]Don't even spend $10 on this controller if the option is available.[SEP]People wanted a total piece of garbage?<br /><br />The concept was so eye-catching: bundle the wiimote AND classic controller in one, make it SNES-like, and let the good times roll.<br /><br />In execution, it's a failure.  It's not really a Wii U controller (and yet the thumbsticks are clicky), the button mapping is horrendous, and the longevity is near zero when compared to first-party controllers.  Besides the battery holding no charge, mine died completely after just a few weeks of usage.  What...the...eff?<br /><br />Don't even spend $10 on this controller if the option is available.[EOS]

[BOS]Roku updated the Roku 2 and Roku 3.[SEP]co/1cgYQKA[SEP]Roku updated the Roku 2 and Roku 3. The new Roku 2 is basically the old Roku 3 - but they removed a couple of features. The new Roku 2 is IR only - no more wifi-direct remote so you need line of sight now and no headphone jack in the remote. The Roku 2 is also HDMI only - it WILL NOT work with a CRT TV. I have no idea if Amazon is going to start transparently selling the new Roku 2 if you buy from this page or if this will continue to be the product page for the &#34;older&#34; Roku 2. The older Roku 2 has a model number of 2720R you can find that one here    http://fave.co/1cgYIuK    and apparently the new one is 4210R, obviously here: http://fave.co/1cwGOVA  It looks like the only &#34;current&#34; Roku that will work with a CRT TV is the Roku 1, which (as far as I can tell) is just slower than the &#34;new&#34; Roku 2 but still has composite video output.  SETUP Easy-peasy. Choose language, sign in to network, create an account. Done in 5 minutes. - Minor bug: my wireless network SSID was listed twice. - Minor gripe: had to give my credit card number, but roku.com indicated that I can remove this later via website.  USE Overall, the experience is great. The interface is beautiful and easy to navigate. The remote is simple, responsive, and has great range. Previously, I used my Wii to access Netflix, but the remote range was so small that I had to get up off the couch to control the Wii. With the Roku remote I can control things even from the dining room!  One potential point of confusion is the integration with M-Go. The top level menu has Channels (Netflix, Amazon, Crackle, etc) AND &#34;Movies&#34;, &#34;TV&#34;, etc. At first I thought that &#34;Movies&#34; might mean all movies across all of Netflix, Amazon, etc, but that's not what it is. The &#34;Movies&#34;, &#34;TV&#34; and other selections are actually sub-headings for M-Go, a new Roku partner. I guess as a partner they get premium placement at the top menu level. It's not a big deal, but it was a littleunclear to me.  + Interface is clean, bright, sharp (at least with my HDMI connection) and intuitive. + Remote range is much better than Wii + Everything feels pretty snappy. - Minor gripe: Rewind seems very small (7 seconds?) - Minor gripe: Backarrow button sometimes doesn't work and you need to use the home button.  CHANNELS When you setup the Roku you are prompted to select from some 20+ channels. I found out that there are actually more than 1000 channels available! You can see them on [...] Just to give you an idea of how the channels work (i.e., free vs subscription vs pay-per-use) I categorized my initial channels below. One way Roku could improve the channel experience would be to aggregate movies across all channels you're subscribed to, subdividing into pay-vs-free so that you'd have essentially one &#34;Roku channel&#34; that de-duplicates movies. The result would be something like TV.com which shows movies and which channels host each one.  Subscription - Netflix ($8/mo) - Amazon Instant Prime Video (included with $79/yr Amazon Prime) - HuluPlus ($8/mo)  Pay-per-use - Blockbuster ($4/movie, has trailers, 4784 videos) - Vudu ($4/movie)  Free - PopcornFlix (commercials) - PBS Kids - WSJ - Crackle (with commercials) - Disney (mostly trailers/commercials, but some actual content) - Fox News (with commercials)  Get this, it's worth it!   http://fave.co/1cgYQKA[EOS]

The design is really nice, so I'm a bit sad to have to send it back.  However, the entire bra itself is just way too small -- even the straps are too short.  I don't think even the extra large would fit me.<br /><br />I also ordered a Lamaze large as a backup, and the contrast is incredible.  The Lamaze looks almost twice the size of the Medela bra!  But it fits perfectly.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you have a long torso, or have had a lot of rib cage expansion, don't bother with the Medela bra.  It probably won't fit in any size.[EOS]

The vinyl is very light weight and not sturdy or strong like the industrial professional bounce house. The second time I put it up about a week later once it was up it was not firm enough to hold a toddler and barely held air.

[BOS]The TAN FURREAL FRIENDS HOP 'N CUDDLE BUNNY from Hasbro is a great toy to give away as a gift at Easter.[SEP]This would be a good Easter gift for a younger child and it appeals to girls more than boys.[SEP]The TAN FURREAL FRIENDS HOP 'N CUDDLE BUNNY from Hasbro is a great toy to give away as a gift at Easter. The bunny runs on 3 AA batteries, a set of which is included when you purchase the toy. The fur on this toy mechanical bunny is very soft, which does make it good for cuddling. When you press down on the bunny's back, it begins hopping around in a kind of circle. It also makes a series of different clicking sounds that kind of sound like the bunny is sniffling or nibbling (though they kind of sound like bunny noises, they don't really sound much like the rabbits I've worked with before-they sound more like Bugs Bunny eating a carrot than anything else). There's a switch where you can turn the bunny off if the noise or the hopping becomes too much of a nuisance. The toy is recommended for children four and up. This would be a good Easter gift for a younger child and it appeals to girls more than boys.[EOS]
[BOS]The Worx Jaw Saw does an excellent job of cutting.[SEP]Bill Alexander[SEP]The Worx Jaw Saw does an excellent job of cutting. The idea of an open claw (jaw) serving as a guard for the operating blade and protecting it is an ideal design to hold the saw in place during cuitting. The other plus in the design of the Saw Jaw is the is the oscillating small blade enhoused in the Jaw making for easier and safer cutting.<br /> I used the Saw for the first time this afternoon, Friday, !/ 16/ 2015. It met what I desired in it's performance.<br /><br />Downside: The head, working end, is extra heavy, especially with the extension attachment.<br /><br />I highly recommend the tool.

[BOS]This isn't the "nicest" G-Shock available.[SEP]I have very small wrists and the band fits me just fine.[SEP]This isn't the "nicest" G-Shock available. There are many, more expensive models that come with features like solar charging, radio time-setting, and so on. But honestly, all you really need in a digital watch is toughness, time-telling, and maybe a stopwatch feature. This watch delivers on all those features, and looks pretty cool. I was at a department store and tried to buy a similar watch - they wanted over $100.00 for a watch with the same features as this one. Don't waste your money, this watch has the same basic features, cool look, and legendary toughness of the high-end models for a fair price. The watch is pretty big, but it's lightweight and comfortable to wear. I have very small wrists and the band fits me just fine.[EOS]

[BOS]The HS-81 and the counterpart the HS-82MG are great servos for their size and weight class (there's a new 82HB in the works).[SEP]4 stars, this is a great servo for a fair price but use MG if you have any worry over the gears holding up at this size.[SEP]The HS-81 and the counterpart the HS-82MG are great servos for their size and weight class (there's a new 82HB in the works). These are Analog servos, the Digital versions have 4 digit names, so for example the digital version of the HS-82 servo is HS-5082 (there is no digital HS-81). The digital versions have higher resolution and are important to use in critical areas such as tail accuracy on a Helicopter. For most general purpose flying, analog servos work great.<br /><br />I use a lot of servos.  Keeping a dozen planes and gliders in flyable states causes me to continually build, rebuild and evaluate my servos so I write with the experience of many years.  The HS-81 is very popular for ailerons and flaps, when on a budget but honestly I've blown a few out and had better success switching to the HS-82MG servo, it's not much heavier and the metal gears keep the gears from getting ripped out..  One installation issue is that you'll have to watch the servo width depending on your wing thickness to make sure it fits in there.  If your wings are too thin you'll need to move to the HS-65MG/HB versions.<br /><br />This plastic geared servo weighs 16.6 grams and has 2.6kg of torque at 4.8v and 3.0kg of torque at 6.0v.  In general the MG servos are stronger but have a bit more play than the HB or plastic gears do.  Due to these subtle differences, I pick which to use in any given situation based on how the servos will be abused.  For Glider Flaps where the gears are often stripped due to dragging on the ground during the landing, I use the MG servos.  For the more sensitive Ailerons, I prefer the HB servos that maintain tighter gears and thus more accurate control.  For the rudder usually use MG servos on planes with motors, HB on gliders.  On planes with motors, especially 3D planes with large rudders the Prop Wash is significant and the MG servos hold up really well.  I've also blown out plastic servos by bumping the large rudder via hangar rash (aka non-flying accidents).<br /><br />These servos come with a plus shaped control horn attached and then a double and single arm servo in the box.  They also come with four small flanged mounting screws.<br /><br />I'm sure you've seen the lower cost copies out there.  Let me explain why, even though they may be lower in price, it'll be more difficult to use those.<br />1 They have less reliable quality control.  Sometimes whole batches of the off brand servos are bad and once you've got it in your plane they can be a real pain to change out.<br />2 These servos are more accurate, center better and are more precise in their movements.<br />3 Do you use and toss your gear or do you re-use it?  If you re-use things you really want servos that you know you can get parts for .  Hitec sells servo gears, screws, horns etc so you can change broken pieces out as necessary.<br />4 when you need a special longer horn or special piece you know you can get that for your Hitec servos.  That is not the case for many of the after-market servos.<br /><br />I have tried the lower cost servos and over time, it has been proven to me time and time again to stick with the name brands to get the support and parts I need.  Hitec is amazing for their support; I did have one servo act weird in a rudder for me (it would wag with strong prop wash in big 3D moves.  I sent it in to Hitec with a note and they promptly sent me a new one, even though they could not duplicate the issue.<br /><br />4 stars, this is a great servo for a fair price but use MG if you have any worry over the gears holding up at this size.[EOS]

[BOS]I can't imagine putting anything you love near this thing let alone your little one![SEP])[SEP]I can't imagine putting anything you love near this thing let alone your little one! We received quickly (thanks, Amazon) but the good ended at opening the box and the plastic wrap this was in. It was clearly cheap molded plastic with sharp seam edges (think 1970s toxic junk you do NOT want your kid's mouth on that back then no one knew was toxic -- now with extra BPA!) and even worse, everything and I mean EVERYTHING in the sealed plastic wrap was covered in this gross, smoky, smelly, black soot. I mean really smelly. Like it sat behind the smokestack and next to the cigarette smokers on the trip overseas. Now I know this was made in China and of course I intended to wash it before putting it together BUT this was SO flithy I ended up putting each piece in the shower and the water ran black!<br /><br />But it was still covered in sooty grossness. First I tried green cleaners (the husband was telling me how we need this as our LO is just about to walk and she's in that I-need-to-cling-to-mommy-at-all-moments phase, which is cute, but hard to cook dinner or do laundry, so would I just PLEASE try to clean it and PLEASE give it a try???) and they didn't touch this stuff. Then I moved on to oxyclean and now I was GOING to clean this thing. Nope. Still factory employee fingerprinted black filth all over and by now there was that noxious bad plastic smell from the medium-warm shower water (I didn't want it to melt, just be clean). Finally I used bleach and had to seriously SCRUB each panel. The stickers for the decorations had all peeled off in transit (stick stickers to black dirt and they do not stick) so I didn't have to worry about them until later (Glue on?).<br /><br />But really, I wanted to return it from the get-go because it was gross and cleaning took FOREVER (DD was napping) but DH was home from work, saw the last panel, and he agreed it was filthy. But I almost finally finished cleaning it. I was at the point of thinking well after all that, I *could* cover the bars and top with our cloth crib rails and guardcover....and that might be okay for short periods of time and then DD hopefully wouldn't ingest something toxic or really be in contact with the plastic monstrosity....<br /><br />But then I tried to put this sucker together. Now I'm the one who usually does the putting together from all our computers and electronics to home repairs to assembling furniture from ikea (the bed is a beast, don't do it!), so plastic and screws no problem, right? By the time I got to the third panel, I discovered the bolts for many of the screws after all that cleaning were not made right and they would not fit without my doing metal work and readjusting the threads. So back this toxic nightmare went!<br /><br />We do like the big Graco bugs pack n play, but we were looking for something for the other end of the house and "new" so DD would find it more interesting than what she has and I didn't want to unload the toys from the family room, move the graco, and reload every single time the dryer is done or it's mealtime. Ugh! Big mistake. Waste of time and efforts, please don't let it be yours. AVOID THIS!<br /><br />(OH! But the one thing we did laugh about is this company did not even care enough to really translate the Chinese instructions into English so you get to have all kinds of fun trying to figure out the instructions like Seadog? Yeah, there's a dog and then there's a seal. Guessing it's the seal. It would be pretty easy to put together IF the screws worked though I never did get far enough to figure out the dog door.)[EOS]

Finally found this one that I like. It's easy to use, fast and has over 100 great ad ons pre installed. I really like the interface. It's very straightforward and easy to use. the Media center is kodi and it works great. Had an issue with one of the add ons not working but its also broken on my laptop so I can't blame the box. Streams like a champ even on wifi. I love this box and have recommended it to everybody I know.[EOS]

[BOS]I am a hobbyist saxophone player, playing in a couple of community bands and solo at nursing and assisted living homes, so I do not need a professional level instrument.[SEP]Overall, it was a great buy for a very good horn for an amateur hobbyist sax player.[SEP]I am a hobbyist saxophone player, playing in a couple of community bands and solo at nursing and assisted living homes, so I do not need a professional level instrument. The day I bought this it was on a special sale and was under $300. Tone quality is fine, but tuning has been a slight problem as it required the mouthpiece to be pushed almost the entire length of the cork before in tune. I also initially had a problem with several sticky pads, but after nearly two weeks of treatment and cleaning, that was resolved. Overall, it was a great buy for a very good horn for an amateur hobbyist sax player.[EOS]

[BOS]These pills are pretty good but for now I can only give them a 3 star rating.[SEP]For now I'm giving it 3/5 because it's clearly working and helping me lose weight, I just can't figure out why it fluctuates so damn much.[SEP]These pills are pretty good but for now I can only give them a 3 star rating.<br /><br />I'm almost through with the first bottle I have and the weight loss has been coming and going even though I've been taking the recommended dosage. In my first week I managed to drop 5 pounds and I was very excited because I thought I'd found my miracle pill. The week after that I actually gained 3 of those pounds back even though I was doing the exact same routine. The third week I've managed to lose 4 more pounds from where I was in week 2. It's hard to say if I'm going to get consistent results from these at this point. I'm going to go ahead and finish off the bottle and possibly try another one. For now I'm giving it 3/5 because it's clearly working and helping me lose weight, I just can't figure out why it fluctuates so damn much.[EOS]
[BOS]Call me a freak, but I absolutely love good, gory movies.[SEP]The film is available now, so give it a look.[SEP]Call me a freak, but I absolutely love good, gory movies.  I just can’t help myself.  The more splatter, the better.  Films like Peter Jackson’s DEAD ALIVE or Eli Roth’s CABIN FEVER are some of my favorite splat-fests.  So when I saw the summary for CHEMICAL PEEL, I knew it was a must-see.  Chemical spills are always a great way to initiate some good gory action.  And let me tell you:  this film does not disappoint!  Chocked full of intensity and plenty of splatter, this horror flick is one you must see!<br /><br />I am very impressed with how much I enjoyed this film.  It is good on so many levels.  Great acting, intriguing premise, and excellent special effects (i.e. gore).  You just can’t ask for much more from a horror film.<br /><br />CHEMICAL PEEL starts off with a bang and it never lets up.  The tension is in the air from the get go, and it’s thick enough to feel on your skin.  I love this aspect of the film, as it puts the viewer in the midst of things right off.<br /><br />The acting is great, with a whole cast of unknowns (to me) giving top-notch performances.  I have to give particular note to Natalie Victoria, who portrays the main character, Rae.  Victoria does a stellar job as the role of the downtrodden heroine, and I hope to see more of her work in the future.  I also have to mention Arielle Brachfeld, who plays Rae’s sister, Angela.  Brachfeld does such a great job with her role, it’s almost scary.  She makes Angela into a Grade A bitch.  I can honestly say I have not wanted a character to die so badly in a long time.<br /><br />The special effects in CHEMICAL PEEL win the blue ribbon here, though.  There are several very nice gore scenes, and they don’t leave much to the imagination.  One of my favorites occurs when one of the girls decides to take a shower and wash off some of the muck in the air.  Little does she know that water is a trigger for the chemical reaction.  As a result, the girl melts (literally) in the tub.  This scene is very well done, and it will haunt my memory for a long time!<br /><br />CHEMICAL PEEL is a big win for me, and fans of horror as well as gore-hounds alike will enjoy this one.  Make sure you watch this on an empty stomach, though…even if you’re not very squeamish, some of these scenes will make you look away.  The film is available now, so give it a look.[EOS]

[BOS]This coin purse works quite well.[SEP]Removes the digging back into your pocket for the coin you actually wanted.[SEP]This coin purse works quite well.  Being leather it holds up better than plastic.  It takes a few uses for the leather to begin to confirm to your hand.  I never liked coins loose in my pocket.  The coin purse takes care of that.

[BOS]I'm prone to really dry skin which gets even more difficult to manage in the winter time.[SEP]Still, I use it everyday for my hands and love it so far.[SEP]I'm prone to really dry skin which gets even more difficult to manage in the winter time. The best thing I have found is just to use petroleum jelly, however that leaves your skin very sticky and unpleasant. I've tried using mineral oil as well but that is too light for me. So when I was approached to try this, I was enthusiastic to accept. This Argan oil seems like the perfect fit.<br /><br />The bottle is somewhat small and due to the price, I'm hesitant to use it all over my body. The good part is you need very little to get the job done. One squirt gives you about a pea-sized amount and that is more than enough for hands and even forearms. There is a light, pleasant scent that is natural, and the oil works quickly.<br /><br />The instructions say you can use it in your hair, which I did, but the result wasn't what I hoped. It made my hair look greasy - as if I hadn't washed in several days - instead of shiny and smooth.<br /><br />Still, I use it everyday for my hands and love it so far.[EOS]

[BOS]I had to give this some serious thoughts and considerations before buying this product because of the very low review given by a popular test kithcen.[SEP]I'm especially happy that the risk I took in buying this product was worth my while.[SEP]I had to give this some serious thoughts and considerations before buying this product because of the very low review given by a popular test kithcen. I almost didn't buy it... I actually bought others including the oxo ricer with three settings. The others had their share of flaws. However, the Trudeau ricer really came through and did what I need it to do. That is to rice potatoes and to make noodles with their two blades.  The hopper was a decent size, it has a swivel head that adjusts as it pushes food down through the blades, this adjusustable head has the perfect size fitting the hopper keeping the food down the hopper and out instead of getting pushed back upward, and the handle is comfortable to use. Another concern I had after reading the review was having food left over in the hopper because of a gap due to design flaw... Well, there was no gap. All the food in the hopper was pushed out through the holes leaving no wastes.  I like this product. I'm especially happy that the risk I took in buying this product was worth my while.[EOS]

[BOS]In a word, excellent.[SEP]Highly recommended.[SEP]In a word, excellent. These are superb quality (made in France), cut like a hot knife through butter and have quality, high density plastic handles that have the perfect amount of grip to them. They are well balanced in the hand and have just the right amount of reach to get in and dead head flowers and roses, snip off clusters or fruits or trim other delicate pieces away from your plants. The main draw is that these will get into places where the bulk of regular pruners will not, and where you require finesse and accuracy over leverage and brute strength. Used for that purpose, they definitely outshine the heavier duty pruners/clippers, as well as similar looking import junk. I have long been an advocate for high quality tools, with little patience for poor quality and poor design. These harvesting snips do not disappoint at all and will likely last a lifetime if properly cared for.<br /><br />At this price point, I cannot recommend them enough. Superb quality and wonderful to use. Highly recommended.[EOS]

This is a great vest for conditioning with good weight distribution in upper body pockets.  The weights are easy to load and unload.  Granted, 10 pounds is not that much weight for the upper body, but it makes a big difference for things like climbing stairs and practicing MMA.<br /><br />The inside has enough padding to prevent the 10 pounds of weights (20 half pounds) from creating discomfort.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of people, I do not believe in using this for basketball because it just puts more torque on the knees.[EOS]

Instead of picking up cat poop and pee every day all I do is flush the toilet when it is finished with the cleaning process. I have unfortunately experienced the COOKED poop smell GROSS but I just turned on the fan in my bathroom for awhile then it was gone. Has only happened once.

No more scooping, no more car litter smell, honestly other then the one time poop cook there haven't been a smell. LOVING IT!!![EOS]

[BOS]This product is so poorly made, I wasn't even able to assemble it.[SEP]I'm going to IKEA next time.[SEP]This product is so poorly made, I wasn't even able to assemble it.  There are no tools required for assembling it.  All the parts are supposed to easily slide together.  Except that they don't.  The holes in the black plastic parts aren't large enough to allow the rods to slide in.  And when I tried to pull it apart, it snapped in half.  This was a waste of time and money.  The lesson, as always, is that you get what you pay for.  I'm going to IKEA next time.[EOS]

[BOS]I bought this about two years ago.[SEP]This case will be the only case you'll ever have to buy.[SEP]I bought this about two years ago. 1. The outer case is indestructible. It's actually hinged, unlike some plastic cases that solely depend on a thin piece of plastic connecting the top to the base which over a short amount of usage ALWAYS FAILS, this case's hinge is made like a door, built to be opened and closed hundreds of thousands of times. 2.The inner foam has bee pre-cut to fit Shure SLX and ULX mic's and receivers as well as the power box and other small pieces perfectly.<br /> I would not recommend any other case for delicate Shure mic's than this one. This case will be the only case you'll ever have to buy.[EOS]
[BOS]I got this for my boyfriend's 7 year old daughter.[SEP]It all comes down to expectations.[SEP]I got this for my boyfriend's 7 year old daughter. She's very much into Barbie right now & doing their hair.<br /><br />The doll comes with a brush, a few curlers, barrettes, pony tail holders & 2 &#34;irons&#34; - one regular & one spiral. No heat is needed and they are just plastic. The doll itself comes with a cute outfit and her hair is very long & soft.<br /><br />The curlers are hard to use, they take some force to get them done & undone. I quickly found out that curling the hair takes patience & quite frankly, little girls don't have much of that. Each curl has to be held for 10 seconds. Sometimes it would come out great & other times not so much. The curls don't hold well either. Practice can help but even then, it doesn't look like the photos.<br /><br />Overall, she was happy with the doll since it's a Barbie. The hair curling part, not so much. She continued to play with the hair but think she got bored trying to get it to curl the way she hoped it would. It all comes down to expectations.[EOS]

Would without a doubt prescribe to anyone. This was a blessing for my sister. She expressed that the feet worked flawlessly on her Brother's machine. She said that they did the employment they were assume to do. She will fill me in regarding whether they break or curve, yet so far for the price...they are okay. What's to say in regards to this current: its equitable OK, not super. The feet are a touch light weight. I have not really attempted them just yet, but rather for the couple of times that I would be utilizing each of the feet, they will most likely be fine. A touch of a clarification to run with them would be an in addition to. As it may be, you truly need to go to You Tube to discover what they are.

[BOS]I got this just in time for the last  NFL play off games to go to the Super Bowl.[SEP]Works great with normal tv and it is a very nice picture.[SEP]I got this just in time for the last  NFL play off games to go to the Super Bowl. Everything looked great on regular tv broadcast until I got to the game and noticed the scaling mostly when the teams lined up and the camera shot was panned out. The tv could not keep up with all the little legs going every where and you could see some scaling for a second and you would say what was that. This was very noticeable to me because my old TV did not do this. This happened intermittingly through out the game but not all the time.  This is not a true 240hz refresh rate but Vizio's make believe version of it. Still debating on sending it back... Everything else is great and normal TV looks awesome. Update.... Ended up keeping do to it was so close to super bowl and I needed for a party. I increase my stars to 3 because I don't notice the scaling as much when I used some feature in the menu that was to help the problem but you still see some.  Works great with normal tv and it is a very nice picture.[EOS]

[BOS]My mount came on my DW special edition Buddy Rich tribute kit in the Classic series.[SEP]I love my DW kit, but this rail is the weak link.[SEP]My mount came on my DW special edition Buddy Rich tribute kit in the Classic series. It has some nice features like a quick tightening lever in the L-rod, and it came with some semi-nice features like the memory lock on the rail. The latter may be useful to some folks, but it also takes up some real estate on the rail itself, diminishing how far you can shift the tom position.<br /><br />While the construction is typical DW perfection, the design is not. It incorporates the worst aspects of a rail mount. Specifically, it slips. A simple light knurling on the rail or the inside of the clamp that grabs it would have prevented that. I have to brace the rack tom that is on my kit against my snare drum to hold it in position. To me that is a major failing.<br /><br />On the plus side, the hole pattern will fit the Walberg & Auge rail that was used by Ludwig, Slingerland, Leedy and others when this was the way to mount a tom. I measured it on my 1961 Slingerland lit as well as a Gretsch round badge kit. Of course it will not fit the Ludwig models that had the four-hole pattern that they used in the 1960s.<br /><br />Also, if you are making a purchase decision as to whether this or the [[ASIN:B0016HCG94 Gibraltar SC-GVRM Vint Rail Mount 10.5Mm L-Rod]] will best suit your needs I would personally opt for this one. I have owned and used both and this one is better constructed and sits a little lower for approximately the same price (at the time of this review).  However, be aware that both are flawed and both have slipping problems.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rail for a vintage kit you may want to check out the Steve Maxwell rail that is easy enough to find with a web search. That one is built to the old Walberg & Auge specs,  but with better tolerances and is actually less apt to slip than this DW rail or the Gibraltar model.<br /><br />I love my DW kit, but this rail is the weak link.[EOS]

[BOS]I lost a lot of weight taking these raspberry ketones, but I really wanted to lose it faster than this.[SEP]So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health.[SEP]I lost a lot of weight taking these raspberry ketones, but I really wanted to lose it faster than this. I expected something like 50 pounds in a couple of months and instead I only lost 28 pounds in two months. I know that is still A LOT.<br /><br />On the other hand I never lost so much weight before as I did by taking this supplement. I didn't have a single side effect. No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either. Some other pills I took caused me that a lot.<br /><br />So, this is actually a great product, I'm just an impatient guy. It took me years to get this fat and I want to get rid of it in months. I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products.<br /><br />I think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often.<br /><br />If people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it. So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health.[EOS]

[BOS]Just so you know, Cuisinart said these will be back in stock May 1st and retail again for $39.99.[SEP]The rest of the griddler-thing when it spills over, not so much![SEP]Just so you know, Cuisinart said these will be back in stock May 1st and retail again for $39.99. I went to review and saw these on sale for absurd amounts ($200! Really?!?) and just don't want anyone to have regrets. They work okay but we barely use them. Only once or twice. Glad ours was a gift and not something we paid for out of our own pocket. Certainly not worth more than what you would spend for a dedicated, really good waffle maker. These make thin, square waffles and it takes some time to get the batter mix just right and the amount right where it doesn't run all over the darn thing. Most of the time I whip out my waffle maker instead of bothering because if you are just a teensy bit over, it makes a HUGE mess over the sides and in the drain pan. And if the eggs are too big or small or you add too much seltzer or not enough, it can make the batter too thick or too thin and not cook perfectly. Thinner seems better overall though and you'll have to keep checking but try not to over-check because it won't crisp just right. I just bite my tongue at the mess the husband makes when he tries to "help" and pour one while I'm getting kiddo started eating the first one (another reason I take my waffle maker out now! Bit tongue does not go well with waffles. Nor does a massive cleaning job!). Haven't tried a mix with it because generally I like to make our own. I would not trust this to evenly cook if you add blueberries and strawberries (let alone chocolate or nuts). The cooker cycles off and on and so parts around the fruit will be raw or other parts burned. And I only use it with white flour, not whole grains (which we more often use) because I don't think it would cook properly. Even though we're in a small condo and it's a hassle to get out, my big old flip waffle maker (another wedding gift) that has an indicator when the waffles are done has a better overall texture, fluffy insides, crispy outside, pure-pleasure type of finish and is worth taking the time to get out even on busy nights when we just want something quick for a different, fun dinner. I tend to prefer thin waffles too, but the waffle maker really does a better job over this even if they are a thick. Cleaning the plates on this in the dishwasher are easy. The rest of the griddler-thing when it spills over, not so much![EOS]

[BOS]I looked at a LOT of different knife reviews for the best block set in an good price range.[SEP]Overall I would say I recommend this to anyone looking for good quality knife set but not wanting to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars.[SEP]I looked at a LOT of different knife reviews for the best block set in an good price range. After looking at a lot of products offered and the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites, I settled on this set.  Personally, I am very happy with my choice. The knives are very sharp and they do their job well.  The knives are very light in weight but I personally don't feel that has an effect on their performance.  I think if you want anything fancier you would have to spend hundreds of dollars for a professional set, which of course not everyone wants to do.  I am someone who cooks in the kitchen 6 days a week and I have not been disappointed by any of these knives. They meet my needs perfectly fine.  I should note that the block set comes with a couple of extra slots so I purchased the Wusthof Gourment Santoku and vegetable knifes so that the block would be full.  The Santoku knife does not come with this set but it is my favorite knife because it serves many cutting purposes.  Overall I would say I recommend this to anyone looking for good quality knife set but not wanting to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars.[EOS]

It was labeled as an Optoma part on the website but the box had no indication of the maker. The lamp appeared to be identical to my blown lamp but it was a really sloppy fit in the machine and didn't work at first. I removed it and reinstalled it several times until it finally worked. After an hour of use I turned it off and the next day it wouldn't work again. I checked the Optoma website FAQ and it warned about counterfeit lamps so I returned this one and ordered one from an authorized dealer for double the price. It came in a completely different box with Optoma written all over it. The lamp had an Optoma original part sticker on it. It slid in perfectly with no problems and worked immediately. The manufacturing tolerance on this one was way below Optoma's standards and much sloppier than the factory part.[EOS]

[BOS]I don't know.[SEP]Oh, well![SEP]I don't know...this is a lesson for me to NOT have such high hopes in other people's reviews. Seeing that this was predominantly the only product where reviewers mentioned it being THE BOTTLE for their bottle-refusing baby, I thought that this would be the godsend reviewers pronounced it to be. Not for my kiddo! He wised up at 3 months and we tried a couple of different bottles for about 2.5 months. Heard that the sippy cup might be the way to go, and so the search on Amazon commenced.<br />Like a previous reviewer mentioned, even I had a hard time sucking liquid out of this nipple. I then cut the slits to make them bigger, and that helped with the flow, but in the end my baby reacted in the same way he reacted to the bottle: What?! You're not tricking me with this! Savvy baby. Oh, well![EOS]

[BOS]I live in the desert and have allergies.[SEP]Now I just wish they made Similasan sinus drops.[SEP]I live in the desert and have allergies. My eyes tend to get really dry and itchy. I have a habit of rubbing my eyes, which just makes them worse. I've started using these drops when I feel the urge to rub my eyes, and they are great. They are soothing going in and my eyes don't feel dry or itchy for a while afterwards. I probably use them about 3 - 4 times a day, sometimes more when the weather is really dry. Now I just wish they made Similasan sinus drops.[EOS]
[BOS]Does what it says they will do.[SEP]Nice product![SEP]Does what it says they will do. I've had an outdoor rug on my deck for a year now. The corners have curled up for as long as I can remember. Not anymore! They not only straightened the corners out, but they are just heavy enough to help keep the rug down when it gets windy. The deck is located on a 2nd story and it gets super windy there and the corners tend to blow up exposing the underside of the rug. These have served a dual purpose for me. Nice product![EOS]

[BOS]I got this as gift 2 years ago.[SEP]I would not want anyone else to waste their time on this this poorly executed device.[SEP]I got this as gift 2 years ago. I finally got it out on a rainy day after acquiring a lot of family slides that I wanted to share. Despite the poor manual, I easily installed the software on my Windows 7 PC. The software is kinda' quirky, but works. However after scanning a dozen or so slides at the highest quality setting, I compared the originals to the scanned images. I was very disappointed. Every slide has a blue color cast, while the reds appear to be mostly missing. The contrast range is also poor - the shadows and highlights are totally lost. There are no adjustments to correct these problems. I was not even able to correct the color and contrast adequately in my editing software.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's now destined for the trash bin. I would not want anyone else to waste their time on this this poorly executed device.[EOS]

The earrings are literally about the proper size for toddler with pierced ears. I deserve a refund as it was a complete scam and was not as pictured or promised.<br /><br />Do not buy from this seller.[EOS]

This mattress fits PERFECTLY in her pack N play.  I tried it out for nap time over the weekend and she slept for 2 hours!!!  My baby only takes 30 minute naps!!  I think this is exactly what I needed so we can sleep good on our vacation!  I also had some friends over for game night and we needed to put our babies to bed.  I put the pack N play with the mattress for her little one and he never moved!  She was sold and bought one the very next day!!  This is a GREAT buy!!![EOS]
[BOS]I was really excited about this filter because it looks nearly identical to the Renovo Trio but its a few buck cheaper.[SEP]If you would prefer to buy from a company that tests their own products and stands behind their product without selling your name and contact details to a marketing company, then look elsewhere (Sawyer, Renovo, Berkey even Lifestraw).[SEP]I was really excited about this filter because it looks nearly identical to the Renovo Trio but its a few buck cheaper. Its cheaper because they don't package it properly and because they are selling my contact information and they are using questionable marketing tactics.  First, the packaging; this filter has an activated carbon filter in it. Anyone that knows anything about filtration (air or water) knows that activated carbon MUST BE SEALED. The activated carbon is sensitive enough that it will absorb pollutants in the air and wear out. So, as the filter sits in their warehouse the activated carbon is being used up which means it will have questionable efficacy when you really need it. My filter showed up in a cheap box with a sticker on it. These should be sealed at the factory. I placed mine in a vacuum sealed bag when I got it so hopefully there is still some life left. Being curious as to what I might expect in terms of shelf life, I checked their website and was surprised to find very little technical documentation. It was mostly marketing hype. They apparently haven't done any lab testing to certify the filter in any way. So, I went to Renovo Trio's website to see if they had anything and they had overwhelming amounts of data. I found full testing documentation and some helpful information about the activated carbon filter. According to Renovo (who has done testing), the activated carbon filter is good for 1,000 liters OR 1 year out of its packaging (the Renovo is hermetically sealed). So, if this filter sat in some warehouse for 8 months or so before I received it, then I've got 3-4 months to use it before the activated carbon filter is useless. Don't get me wrong, as a two stage filter, this is pretty good but I paid for a three stage filter and that is what I was expecting.  Second, a week or so after ordering this, I get some telemarketer calling from Survivor Filter trying to get my email and other details so I can end up on some marketing list. I have NEVER had this happen on Amazon and I hope it doesn't become the norm.  So, if you are looking for something that will make you feel like you're prepared (when you really aren't) and you don't care to investigate the validity of a manufacturers claims, buy this! If you would prefer to buy from a company that tests their own products and stands behind their product without selling your name and contact details to a marketing company, then look elsewhere (Sawyer, Renovo, Berkey even Lifestraw).[EOS]

It has to be one of the best Chromium Picolinate's I have taken to date and I love that it comes in a small grape flavored chewable. You only need one a day to get up to Dr Andrew Weil's recommended 1000 mcg's and it's very apparent that the mcg's are correct. Solaray is a brand that I trust and have had good results with in the past. Sadly I have experimented with supplement brands I have never heard of before and found that the mcg's were likely a lot less than stated on the label. I'll be re-ording these by Solaray again and again. As others have mentioned it feels as if this lozenge form is being absorbed better.<br /><br />As with any supplement it's always important to talk with your physician first. The nice thing about Chromium Picolinate is it's been around for many years now and is pretty well known among health care givers unlike the newer fad supplements.[EOS]

[BOS]I've had and used this printer for nearly 2 months now.[SEP]For my basic home use, this has been a great printer, I especially love the scan feature and the port for SD card reading on the front.[SEP]I've had and used this printer for nearly 2 months now.  The pictures I've printed come out nice, though they fall a little short of my expectations.  I do like the 6 cartridge feature for ink on this printer.  It is easy to use.  I have it connected by wifi, fortunately I was already wifi ready as I didn't realize a cable was not included...The scanner is great and very simple to use.  The biggest drawback on this unit is the paper tray.  It is located under the output tray.  The output tray, (where the completely printed pages come out) slides in and out so the unit can be closed.  When open, if you need to refill the paper tray, you need to remove the printed pages and close the output tray in order to easily access the paper tray.  I've also had some issues with multiple sheets being sucked in for printing, but that may be due to me reusing paper on the backside.  Don't know.  For my basic home use, this has been a great printer, I especially love the scan feature and the port for SD card reading on the front.[EOS]
[BOS]First off I want to say I love them and am very happy with the purchase.[SEP]If you have have tiny holes that want to close up fast then these might give you the right amount of stretch to your holes to open them up a bit but keep in mind you should treat your ears as re-pierced for awhile till they have a chance to get used to being this size.[SEP]First off I want to say I love them and am very happy with the purchase. I got the 4mm in stainless set. I can even see buying the gold 4mm set as well in the future. The colors are lovely and the stones are large enough to really show the color. The packaging was small sterile piercing packs so if you are using them to actually pierce your or somebody 's ears then that might matter to you. I didn't get these for piercing, only for my own use as regular earrings.<br /><br />These have large posts and I knew that from other reviews before buying. I have ears that want to close up fairly fast so that didn't bug me. I actually wanted the larger posts to help stretch my tiny holes just a bit. However they are large posts and that might be a problem for some. For those unfamiliar gauge numbers, they get smaller as the size gets bigger. I used a caliper to measure the earrings I was pierced with and those are a 20 gauge. 18 to 20 gauge are typically used for most regular earrings. These measure out very close to a 16 gauge. Perhaps just a bit smaller like a 17 gauge? They are a bit tight for me going in and probably will be for most people who don't have their ear piercings stretched. They will fit but just be aware that it is bigger then most posts. These earring posts are just big enough to cause me a touch of discomfort and a speck of blood from getting them in. I am hoping to get my holes to this size because my ears just want to close.<br /><br />The only other thing I feel I should mention is that the posts seem to be the same actual length as most of my other earrings however...These earrings don't fit like others because of the thicker posts. It feels shorter on the ear. Now I have fairly thin earlobes and these do feel fine but because of the thicker post the post feels shorter as well. Like I said its pretty much the same length post as almost all the others I have. It just feels shorter.<br /><br />Here is my take on these.<br /><br />If you have thick earlobesthese probably won't work for you.<br />If you have tiny holes then these might feel uncomfortable going in. Even cause a touch of bleeding.<br /><br />If you have holes that are a bit stretched already then these might fit better then regular 18 or 20gauge.<br />If you have have tiny holes that want to close up fast then these might give you the right amount of stretch to your holes to open them up a bit but keep in mind you should treat your ears as re-pierced for awhile till they have a chance to get used to being this size.[EOS]

[BOS]****No Plot Spoilers****

  Ever since watching Brian De Palma's "Carrie" ([[ASIN:B0047E9TRA Carrie]]) and "The Fury" ([[ASIN:B000G6BLO2 The Fury]]), I've been obsessed with telekinesis.[SEP]Joseph B. Hoyos[SEP]****No Plot Spoilers****<br /><br />  Ever since watching Brian De Palma's "Carrie" ([[ASIN:B0047E9TRA Carrie]]) and "The Fury" ([[ASIN:B000G6BLO2 The Fury]]), I've been obsessed with telekinesis.  The Scanners franchise also fulfilled my desire to watch people move objects with their thoughts.  The original "Scanners" ([[ASIN:B00005K3NY Scanners]]) was directed by David Cronenberg who became famous for his controversial science fiction horror films starring controversial actors [e.g., "The Brood" ([[ASIN:B00009PY2T The Brood]]), with brawler hunk Oliver Reed, and "Rabid" ([[ASIN:B0001XAKUQ Rabid]]) with former porn star Marilyn Chambers].  "Scanners" focuses on an emotionally disturbed, homeless scanner, Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) who meets an art gallery assistant, Kim Obrist (supermodel Jennifer O'Neill) who is also a scanner.  Together, they attempt to locate an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), who wants the scanners to rule the world.  During their quest, they discover the dark secret concerning the origin of scanners.  Note: Scanners not only have the ability to move objects with their thoughts, but they can also read (i.e., scan) and manipulate other people's thoughts.  However, many become insane because of sensory overload.<br /><br />  Having owned "Scanners" on DVD for years, I was naturally thrilled to learn that Shout Factory had released its first two sequels as a Blu-Ray and DVD combo pack.  I saw them on VHS too many years ago in muted, full-frame formats.  Thanks to Shout Factory, each film has been presented correctly in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  All colors are bright, clear and crisp and the audio is great (DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo for Blu-Ray; Dolby Digital Stereo for DVD).  Each film appears as though it has been recently released at the theatre.  There are no vertical lines or dark splotches.  I played the DVD version on my Blu-Ray player and couldn't tell a significant difference from the Blu-Ray.  The remastering for both the Blu-Ray and the DVD has been excellent.  I`ll be able to loan the DVD to my girlfriend, Tammy, who doesn't own a Blu-Ray player.  A horror buff like me, she's going to kill me with her evil thoughts when she learns I watched these films without her.<br /><br />  Both Scanners II and III were directed by Christian Duguay.  Like "Scanners," they boast gorgeous casts, contain themes of good versus evil and were filmed in and around the cold, gray environs of Montreal and Quebec, Canada.  In "Scanners II: The New Order," a veterinarian student, David Kellum (David Hewitt) is a scanner on the run who finds another scanner, Julie Vale (Deborah Raffin); together they try to destroy the corrupt Commander John Forrester (Yvan Potton) who is using scanners to kill anyone who stands in his way of becoming mayor.  Similar in plot to the original "Scanners," it has, however, some shocking twists.  Also, it has considerably more gore and violence than the original.  This one was more emotionally disturbing to me because it deals more with violence perpetrated against family members.<br /><br />  In "Scanners III: The Takeover," a Christmas tragedy causes a scanner, Alex Monet (Steve Parrish), to become a monk in Thailand.  Meanwhile, his sister, Helena (Liliana Komorowska), also a scanner, is suffering from severe migraine.  She uses her father's experimental drug and becomes insanely diabolical.  She then commandeers her father's pharmaceutical company to take over the world.  As in the previous film, there is a tremendous amount of violence and gore.  Again, there is familial violence; this time, it is even sadder when relatives attempt to kill one another.  Note: I loved the unforgettable character of Helena.  She is extremely diabolical, beautiful and sensual.  Komorowska played her perfectly.<br /><br />  There are two discs in this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.  One disc contains both films on DVD and the other disc contains both films on Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately, the combo pack doesn't have any extras.  There are no subtitles, no audio commentaries, no theatrical trailers, no deleted scenes, no "making off featurettes," and, worst of all, no scene selections.  The menu gives you a choice of which Scanners movie to watch and that is all.  Unbelievable!  If not for the widescreen presentations, stereo audio and remastering, I would have thought that these two films had been released by Mill Creek, which churns out films on Blu-Ray and DVD at a high rate, regardless of quality.  Because of its blatant lack of extras, I cannot give this Scanners II and III Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack the highest rating.<br /><br />  If you are a fan of horror films, especially the ones involving telekinesis, then I recommend this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.  However, I wish Shout Factory had either included a digital copy or just decreased the price and given us the choice of buying the Blu-Ray or the DVD, not both.  I also wish that Shout Factory or another company would properly release "Scanner Cop" and "Scanner Cop 2: Volkin's Revenge" on Blu-Ray.  Both films star Daniel Quinn as Detective Samuel Staziak who hunts down rogue scanners.  The original "Scanners," released by MGM and out of print at the time of this review, also deserves the Blu-Ray treatment.  Many fans are hoping it will be re-released by the Criterion Collection.  My MGM release of "Scanners" only has a theatrical trailer and subtitles for extras.  A commentary from David Cronenberg would be nice.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos[EOS]

[BOS]Great for emergency water.[SEP]Overall 4 stars for value.[SEP]Great for emergency water.  I recently filled my whole bath tub and it worked just fine.  My only complaints were the plastic piece that connects from the faucet into the waterbob had a few holes.  It does take a while to fill up, but it held the water for 3 days.  I would also like to note that the siphon is not the greatest as the water comes out slowly.  Oh and remember it's not reusable.  Overall 4 stars for value.[EOS]

[BOS]This is sturdy enough for chicks to grow in.[SEP]Elegant.[SEP]This is sturdy enough for chicks to grow in.  I bought 2 & put extra panels in the original as I have 24 chicks in the enclosure.  It was easy to add the panels & the extra lamp hanger.  I doubted the sturdiness until I set it up.  It's all you would need.  I set it up in a stall in the barn.  Chicks are now 2 1/2 weeks old & practicing flight skills.  The 18&#34; height is sufficient to contain the adventurous.  I love that it will collapse into small storage unit awaiting next year's chicks.  I am now using this double set up for the 3rd set of chicks.  I am expanding it with 3rd unit to accommodate 45 chicks.  I do NOT use the hangars for my heat lamp,  I use a camera tripod to which I've attached a C-clamp for  double securing heat lamp and this I use for just the 1st week in May.  Then to decrease risk I switch to a Lectro-Kennel heated pad which has hard plastic cover.  I'm  now investing in a Brinsea brooder for overhead radiant heat which has none of the risks of heatlamp.

ianpjohnson@yahoo.com[SEP]Lots of people have enjoyed the Annapurna Circuit using this guidebook, which is a well established successful independent guidebook, written by a trekker for trekkers. The mountains and views have not moved since the original research trek, nor have the villages, the GPS locations are the same, the distance between the villages is the same, the cultural descriptions are still accurate, the mountaineering history has not changed much. The prices have changed, but that's inflation for you! The lodge menus will have changed, I expect for the better. There is now a road to Chamje and from Muktinath, but you don't have to get on the bus if you don't want to.<br /><br />The guidebook is printed by Amazon for each order, it's called "print on demand" and it enables high quality independent publishers to compete with big publishers, like you-know-who. This Annapurna guidebook has been praised since it was first published and is a great way to plan your trek.<br /><br />All I can say in conclusion is get off your computer and go do the trek. It's the experience of a lifetime, and this guidebook will help you along the way, and help you have some fun too.<br /><br />Ian Johnson<br />ianpjohnson@yahoo.com[EOS]

Yes, it does get a little hot with continuous use as other reviewers stated before.<br />I bought mine in October 2013, and it does remove HDCP protection (tested with a PS3) which is the main reason you might be taking a look at this item.<br />It is quite small and &#34;portable&#34; (sans the power supply) so you would have no problem hiding it.<br /><br />The main issue with my unit (perhaps defective?) is that the sound will either crack or just be gone completely. I'm yet to find out if the problem is due to the TV, the capture card ([[ASIN:B00840353W Elgato Game Capture HD (10025010)]]) or this unit, but in any case I don't lose too much sleep over it as I'm using optical audio to playback and record (as opposed to audio via HDMI) but it's definitely something you should have in mind, if not using the optical out port of whatever device you intend to capture.<br /><br />Overall it works for my purpose (HDCP breaking) and I'm happy with the product, but I already found a similar product (not on amazon so cannot link) that apparently works and doesn't require a power supply, so I might be heading towards that direction (the power supply is something I quite not like that much about this product, as it's one extra thing to be taking space on my -already getting crowded- UPS).<br /><br />I haven't had the chance to try 3D yet to see if it works, maybe when I do I'll come back and update the review.[EOS]
[BOS]I bought the tunerless one(ZV427MG9), not the one with the tuner(ZV457MG9),from K-Mart.[SEP]DVD plays automatically when turned on, which can be annoying if you want to use the VHS instead, so you have to wait to stop the DVD or eject it.[SEP]I bought the tunerless one(ZV427MG9), not the one with the tuner(ZV457MG9),from K-Mart.  The instructions aren't the most straightforward, but with carfeul reading they can be figured out.  I went through a few DVDRs before I could figure out to record from VHS to DVD, but I figured it out,  The good thing about this is it has Composite, S-vide(great for recording to my Dazzle capture card with Amcap and Windows Media Encoder), Component(Both interlaced and Progressive), HDMI(both YPbPr and RGB)(great for TVs like some Sonys that have no composite or S-Video inputs, you can use this as an RF modulator)) outputs, digital 5.1 coax audio output, and an extra set of L and R audio coutputs(wish they had volume control, but don't).  And for inputs, 2Composite, 2 S-Video(which is great for recording from my computer's GeForce3 video card), both stereo.  4 Head VCR looks great through HDMI, as does the DVD.  Has nice manual tracking.  Not sure if it can record to S-Vhs at optimum quality.  Also, keep in mind "upscaling" will not make your video any higher definition than it was originally recorded.  But the upscaling is good for cheap TVs like Westinghouse that don't give you many screen sizing options.  Cons:  One model of this has a tuner(ZV457MG9), the other does not(ZV427MG9(mine)).  Not a VCD or SVCD recorder, only plays VCD.  Not a multi regional DVD player, won't even play all region PAL DVDs, though it does play my PAL no region DVD-Rs made from my computer.  DVD recorder does not deinterlace the video recorded to the DVD, which might leave heavy lines on the image, especially with up and down motion image quality may be reduced, compared to a deinterlaced image recorded(through a capture card with Amcap and WIndows Media Encoder or similr program, or screencaptured from a DVD played from a computer's drive) to a computer, quality may be inferior, but the Closed Captioning signal does show when outputted through an interlaced output on the player, like composite, S-video, and Component(interlaced only, ie. not progressive scan).  Has stupid Macrovision copy protection, which prevents recording of certain things.  VCR is incapable of recording or playing PAL signals.  As with most video aplliances these days, you need to have the remote.  No volume control.  No LP/EP option for recording with VCR.  DVD plays automatically when turned on, which can be annoying if you want to use the VHS instead, so you have to wait to stop the DVD or eject it.[EOS]

My first born had colic and he rarely slept during the day and at night he wanted to be propped up.  He did not like to lay flat ever.  I read about this product and decided to give it a try it was perfect.  I didn't have to put him on his stomach or put a wedge in his crib which made me nervous.  This allowed me to put him on his back and be tilted.  I was able to put this next to my bed so I could rock him gently back to sleep after feedings.

These saws excel at fine, delicate and exacting cuts. The blades are thin and flexible. They also make a great saw for cutting PVC pipe or back cutting the door moldings when installing laminate flooring. And I could go on. But won't. So buy one of these. You'll find out. Vaughn makes nice ones; this is my second Vaughn saw. The saw is made in Japan which is where draw saws were invented.

Many years ago I used this to strip a cabinet top and all it did was make a stinking mess.  I ended up trying it again after all these years on a bureau because of a nearly full can was offered to me by a neighbor.  Well nothing has changed as far as I am concerned.  It still takes a lot more than just a quart can to get anything done, and it is horribly stinky with a lot of work.  I used the whole can and ended up with six good sized rags that were soaked and I still had more than half the bureau to go.  And worst of all, the part that did strip looked like hell anyway when it dried.  I finally finished the job with a good quality lacquer thinner that not only made a lot less mess, but also did the job far more efficiently, and cheaper.  I'll never be using this stuff again.<br /><br />Fiormbys may make some decent oils for the serious cabinet maker, furniture restorer, but as far as this stuff is concerned, nothing has changed from my experience with it years ago.

It's an amazing performance piece, with the history of mankind broken down into a series of vignettes that use modern behavior to explain how we developed over thousands of years. Essentially riffing on how absurd our behavior is when we're combative and tribal, Quinn somehow manages to hold the thing together throughout, and there's a good laugh about every 25 seconds, which by any show's standards is good.

It's a great book to read when your in your early high school years so that you can learn some valuable lessons from the characters in the book. Maybe if you don't want to listen to your parents experiences you'll listen to what these characters go through trying to get around the popularity contests, boyfriend stealers, and fake friends. This book has a lot of ups and downs leaving the reader wondering if it will be a happy ending or one of those books that like to go by “Reality”.

For my kids, the included anchors are a joke, my 5 year old will have a wonderfully creative excuse, but they will still pull it out of the wall by yanking on their towels.  I would suggest putting a more significant wall anchor that, combined will support 100+ lbs of pull (these are usually toggle bolts or snap toggles http://www.amazon.com/Toggler-Snaptoggle-Toggle-Drywall-Molly/dp/B005C4YE4M )<br /><br />This hook set looks expensive and the value for the price point is there.

The overall height is less than 23” from the floor to the top of the rail.  From the floor to the flat surface is 18-1/2”.  I foolishly thought the height measurement listed referred to the flat surface rather than the rail.  It is really too short to be a nightstand or end table.  I bought it for inside a closet for my Mother use for her socks & stuff when she comes each year for an extended visit, thinking we could then remove her suitcase from the room to give her more space.  But this little guy is so low to the ground she will have to stand on her head to access the drawers.  I’m going to try to find something to set it on, to make it easier for her to use.  That said, it is well made, lightweight, the black paint has been evenly applied, the drawers have a thin cloth lining, and it arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.  The swivel wheels on the one I received do not lock, so one has to hold the stand in place with one hand while opening drawers with the other.  This will be a 5-star purchase if you have need of something very small that rolls around, but it is certainly not ideal as a side table or for easy-use drawers.[EOS]

[BOS]My wife saw these water stations being used  at the Irvine Pet Adoption Event in 2007, the year we adopted Sadie, our 3rd Lab rescue.[SEP]So great product and service and my wife was right again.[SEP]My wife saw these water stations being used  at the Irvine Pet Adoption Event in 2007, the year we adopted Sadie, our 3rd Lab rescue. They were set out around the venue to water the guests.  I thought they were a little pricey for a 5 gallon bucket but we were tired of those cheap 5 gallon Pet mate plastic jugs that kept breaking. And they are not that cheap once you break 5 or 6 of them. How can you clean the algae out of those things anyway?  But I digress, so If I was at work, my wife could barely lift that 5 gallon jug , invert it and plant it squarely into the base without breaking the jug or spilling water everywhere. So I bought a Critter Cooler and now I have two, one for inside one for outside, our daughter has a 3.5 gallon, our neighbor has one and we bought another 6.5 gallon and donated it to our local animal shelter. These things are awesome.. I love the little yellow plug so we can drain the bowl and clean the drool and gunk without wasting the water in the tank.. The wheels are high quality, at the Home Depot they would cost about $7 each. And when we got our daughter her Critter Cooler, it was missing a valve, so we called the company and the owner, James, called us back and apologized, sent the part priority mail that day and included a bottle of his dog shampoo. So great product and service and my wife was right again.[EOS]

[BOS]These Monster In-Ear Headphones are my first Monster product that is not a cable.[SEP]THERE ARE MANY ON THE MARKET AND MOST OF THEM WILL BRING YOUR MUSIC TO A NEW LEVEL.[SEP]These Monster In-Ear Headphones are my first Monster product that is not a cable. Monster has taken the headphone market by storm and grabbed a huge market share. Why? Is it because they are really good or is it because they are experts on marketing their products? Don't know but it's probably both.<br /><br /> These bright cobalt blue ear-buds have a very good sound. The treble is sweet and high without being tinny. The base is surprisingly good for ear-buds and it doesn't sound muddy. The mids fill in the middle well. The overall sound is crisp without being harsh, smooth without being muddy.<br /><br />The cable is 50 inches long.<br /><br />The packaging looks great if you are giving them as a gift.<br /><br />Lightweight so not to pull out of the ear easily.<br /><br />Three sizes of lite rubber ear cups are provided so they should fit just about anyone.<br /><br />Comes with a small velcro tie for keeping the cable wrapped up and a lapel clip.<br /><br />The ear-buds are magnetized on the back so you can stick the two ends together.<br /><br />For the price it would have been nice to have a case included.<br /><br />Well constructed with a solid feel.<br /><br />The jack turns at a 45 degree angle.<br /><br />Can be used for cell phone use with built-in mic. (I do not use this controller)<br /><br />The cable is flat instead of the usual round which seems to not tangle as easily.<br /><br />Overall these are a great sounding pair of ear-buds. Although pricier then many products out there they are way cheaper then high-esr in-the-ear phones. I think you'll be pleased with them.<br /><br />NOTE: IF YOU WANT THE BEST SOUND OUT OF ANY EAR-BUDS, IF YOU ARE USING A SMART PHONE OR TABLET, DOWNLOAD A GOOD EQUALIZER APP. THERE ARE MANY ON THE MARKET AND MOST OF THEM WILL BRING YOUR MUSIC TO A NEW LEVEL.[EOS]

[BOS]I was really disappointed in the Panasonic DMC-ZS45K Lumix.[SEP]There are a lot of cheaper cameras that take great pictures with so much less hassle.[SEP]I was really disappointed in the Panasonic DMC-ZS45K Lumix.  I had really high hopes for it as the functionality that is listed in the description really makes it sound like a great point and shoot camera.  I have experience with lots of different digital cameras, from the more sophisticated D-SLR cameras to the simplest disposables.  So I was really let down with this one.<br /><br />First off, for the casual user who just wants a simple point and shoot camera, I would not recommend this.  Panasonic did a horrible job of making the basic camera functions as complex as possible, requiring several steps to making adjustments that other cameras innately have available with one click or turn of a dial.  However, even if this wasn't an issue, which after a few days of use it became a little easier to remember where certain features were located, the biggest problem that I have with this camera overall is the horrible delay between pressing the shutter release button and time it takes the camera to snap the photograph.  This drove me crazy on my old freebie smart phone, so when this decently priced camera did it I was really shocked.  Basically what happens is you go to take a picture of say your children, so you line them up, tell them to smile, and push the button, you can almost count to two before the camera takes the picture.  At this point everyone has moved and the picture comes out all wrong or blurry.  It's really a shame.  I even switched the setting over to &#34;action&#34; so that it would increase the shutter speed time, and the results were exactly the same.  So if you tried to use the &#34;action&#34; mode to catch a thrilling shot at a sporting event or something, the picture would be about two seconds later than the one you tried to take!  At that timing, what's the point?<br /><br />I tried playing with the &#34;WINK&#34; setting for taking selfies, and that also needs some more engineering from Panasonic.  It works, but barely.  After setting the camera to take a picture using a &#34;wink&#34; (in the same menu as the countdown mode) you have to really be patient with it, and stand there looking like a crazy person winking slowly at your camera in an over emphasized manner in order for the camera to start a 3 second countdown to take the picture.  Even then, I could only get it to take a picture once every ten or so attempts.  Or you could just set the camera to countdown mode, press the shutter button, and the 3 second countdown happens exactly the same way.<br /><br />For more experienced photographers, Panasonic didn't help you out either.  The manual settings for adjusting aperture and shutter speed require four different steps, toggling between menu functions in order to make your adjustments.  It really shouldn't be that difficult to do these kind of changes, and really wastes a lot of good opportunities by forcing you to do them.<br /><br />There are a lot of cheaper cameras that take great pictures with so much less hassle.[EOS]

[BOS]Once my skin turned 50+ I realized I could no longer get away with the washcloth and a promise so I began my search.[SEP]Thanks to Clarisonic my search is over![SEP]Once my skin turned 50+ I realized I could no longer get away with the washcloth and a promise so I began my search. I have been using my Mia once a day and later twice a day since I got it. It makes my face feel and look much cleaner and is also good for gentle exfoliation without the drying effect of some of the "sandpaper" types of machines. My skin looks more radiant and I can see the gradual improvement. It also feels wonderful to use it with its gentle massaging effect. The charger is the easiest thing I have ever used and is much more water friendly than any plug system.<br /><br />At first I used it with my previous facial cleanser. Later I tried it with the Clarisonic foaming gel cleanser that comes with it. I like both for different reasons and use one in the am and the other in the pm. However, if you are using topical spot treatments with stronger products, you should use them afterwards to avoid spreading those all over your face. Thanks to Clarisonic my search is over![EOS]
[BOS]I purchased a can of this locally on a whim with low expectations since it was in a can.[SEP]And it's an inexpensive alternative as well as a convenient one.[SEP]I purchased a can of this locally on a whim with low expectations since it was in a can. Frankly, I was delightfully surprised by how flavorful it is.<br /><br />To the folks whose reviews claim that this is mis-labeled hummus instead of baba ghanouj - I disagree. Perhaps the confusion comes from the denser consistency of this product. If you follow the directions by adding some olive oil and lemon and thoroughly mixing it in, then the consistency will be that of a well made baba ghanouj. The directions also call for mixing in crushed garlic, which is essential to achieve an authentic flavor. I believe those ingredients were left out of the can and left to the buyer to increase shelf life.<br /><br />After mixing in the lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic I also add a pinch of cumin into the mix. Right before serving I will sometimes sprinkle cumin or summac over the top for an added flavor as well as drizzle more olive oil over the top of the baba ghanouj in the serving dish or bowl.<br /><br />There are a few nutritional facts you should take into account: there are about ten servings in a can, and each one contains 180mg of sodium. If you are on a low sodium diet you need to be careful of how much you consume. Also each serving contains 2.5 grams of fat of which a half gram is saturated. This is BEFORE you add olive oil, which will raise the fat content per serving by another 14 grams of fat per tablespoon of oil used when you mix the baba ghanouj. Each of the ten servings is 40 calories before adding in the olive oil, which contains an additional 140 calories per tablespoon.<br /><br />While the above nutritional facts look dismal, bear in mind that they are about par for any properly prepared baba ghanouj - although you can control the sodium content by making this dish from scratch. Although my diet is restrictive I can break the rules occasionally when I want baba ghanouj but am too lazy to make it myself. Used in moderation this is an excellent alternative and one that is authentic if you follow the directions and mix in the missing ingredients and garnish to taste. And it's an inexpensive alternative as well as a convenient one.[EOS]
[BOS]the dagger is great but the metal parts come off preaty easily from the plastic black area, I used superglue to fix this.[SEP]I tried stabbing an old school workbook and it went in about 1/2 inches but when I ran the blade across my hand to see how sharp it was it didnt cut me even when I put three pound of pressure so I sharpened it and now I can shave with it, Ha ha ha![SEP]the dagger is great but the metal parts come off preaty easily from the plastic black area, I used superglue to fix this. Its not that sharp but extreamely pointy so be careful. Also the blade moves very slightly to the right and left and makes clicking sounds. Lastly there is a dence foam in the shethe that holds the blade in place but that gets pocked and ripped by the dagger. I rated this five stars becuase it is awemazing quality for the price but if it were $20 I would probably rate it a 3. A great buy and it is best if left on a stand to show it off sice it wont cut much but it can stab. I tried stabbing an old school workbook and it went in about 1/2 inches but when I ran the blade across my hand to see how sharp it was it didnt cut me even when I put three pound of pressure so I sharpened it and now I can shave with it, Ha ha ha![EOS]
[BOS]I purchased this watch as I found myself taking off all the metal-banded watches when I spent a good amount of time typing.[SEP]Everything seems to be high quality and I'm happy with the purchase.[SEP]I purchased this watch as I found myself taking off all the metal-banded watches when I spent a good amount of time typing. The metal bands were uncomfortable as I rested my wrist on the desk/keyboard. This watch appealed to me as it seemed to be good quality and classy even with a cloth band. I was a little worried at the number of reviews that complained the watch was smaller than advertised.<br /><br />I recieved the watch today and am very pleased. I'm a large man at 6'2&#34; and the watch fits my wrist well. I would never have occured to me to think of the watch as small without seeing the other reviews. Looks like the size of a normal watch to me. Everything seems to be high quality and I'm happy with the purchase.[EOS]

[BOS]We recently picked up a 1998 F150 at a federal surplus auction for just over $500.[SEP]Good luck with your upgrades.[SEP]We recently picked up a 1998 F150 at a federal surplus auction for just over $500. To get it roadworthy we needed to replace the rusted-out front bumper with a new one (also purchased through Amazon). The kids and I decided to add the foglights while we had the bumper off. The original only had pieces of plastic covering the holes, but our Expedition has similar lights and these are much nicer looking than the original equipment. We took a picture of the before and after (different cameras and different sun lights, so paint looks different), and I can tell you that these lights sparkle like a diamond in a ring.  These lights are helping to turn this old &#34;beater&#34; into a &#34;bragger&#34;! I don't think you can beat the value. I am pretty impressed. Good luck with your upgrades.[EOS]

[BOS]This is my second Luminox watch.[SEP]That's not a big problem and I highly recommend this watch.[SEP]This is my second Luminox watch.  After ten years I was just looking for a change. The first one still runs and looks great even though I wore it 24/7. They are sturdy, waterproof watches with great illumination - visible in any light or none at all.  The luminescent tube at each hour mark run around the circumference of the dial with a slightly different color (yellow) at 12 O'clock.  I assume that is why it's called "color mark".  The older watch has the hour mark tubes positoned along the radius (center to edge of the dial) with twin tubes at 12 O'clock.  I feel the later setup makes it slightly easier to read in total darkness.  That's not a big problem and I highly recommend this watch.[EOS]

[BOS]The Wire is one of my favorite shows of all time.[SEP]If you have any comments or critiques, please feel free to reply.[SEP]The Wire is one of my favorite shows of all time. I wasn't aware of it when it was still airing on HBO, but after hearing rave reviews I decided to purchase the box set and go from there. As my opening sentence asserts, that was a great decision.<br /><br />Except for the quality of the actual discs. Like others on here have mentioned, this box set is just not up to par. Four of my discs had disc read issues, and one of them managed to completely stop working mid-season. I've since had the entire set replaced, and although the new one works much better, from time to time it still skips or pauses randomly. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what happened during the production run of these as writing DVDs is usually a rather simple process, but something was definitely up.<br /><br />I wouldn't normally recommend this as I'm a firm believer that piracy is wrong, but my suggestion would be to buy the set so the cast and crew get their royalties and also downloading a digital copy for pain-free viewing. It's not illegal if you own the product, and honestly it'll save you quite a few headaches. I'm not going to provide you with a link, but let's just say it's not too hard to find if you're so inclined.<br /><br />I don't want to write a mini review on the series as there's many others out there, but I will say that the extra features in this set are fantastic and absolutely worth the price. They really let you delve into the world of Baltimore and see why it's such a terrible self reinforcing cycle. David Simon, despite being a bit of an a**hole, is nothing short of a genius.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review! If you have any comments or critiques, please feel free to reply.[EOS]

[BOS]I ordered this inflation gun as my old analog gauge gun had a straight connection that did not work with my Kawasaki Ninja 650 motorcycle.[SEP]I like the lock down feature of this gauge as it makes the connection secure and you don't have to worry about maintaining a good valve connection while filling the tire.[SEP]I ordered this inflation gun as my old analog gauge gun had a straight connection that did not work with my Kawasaki Ninja 650 motorcycle. I needed a compact 90 degree head angle to reach the valve. It works well and is easy to read. My only concern is calibration. An analog gauge can be easy to see if it is off zero. A digital gauge is not so easy so you have to trust that it stays in calibration. On the plus side for digital is the ability to read to tenths of a PSI.<br />I like the lock down feature of this gauge as it makes the connection secure and you don't have to worry about maintaining a good valve connection while filling the tire.[EOS]
[BOS]This genuinely saved my family over $4000.[SEP]Best fix ever.[SEP]This genuinely saved my family over $4000.<br />Car: 2003 Audi A6 3.0 Quattro.<br />Mileage: 85,000 miles.<br />Problem: Check engine lights for BOTH variable valve timing actuators sticking.  Condition present 75% of the time, so occasionally they would unstick.<br /><br />I put 1 quart of MMO into the oil.  I expected nothing, but for $10, why not.  Over the next 2000 miles, a miracle.  The check engine light for this problem would come on less and less until it stopped coming on at all.  The MMO cleaned and lubricated the heads (where the VVT actuators reside) enough to restore normal operation.<br /><br />I have never believed in a simple additive like I believe in Marvel Mystery Oil.  It is incredible.<br /><br />Update:<br />Now 2013, the Audi still has not had this problem come back.  Best fix ever.[EOS]
[BOS]I was horrified to see the recipes are pretty basic (designed for kindergarten kids) and doesn't' even have 1 picture.[SEP]This is an okay book with average recipes nothing more than 1 or 2 stars.[SEP]I was horrified to see the recipes are pretty basic (designed for kindergarten kids) and doesn't' even have 1 picture. For example, the author Michael Matthews tells me how to make PEANUT BUTTER AND OATMEAL, do I really need to be taught how to mix peanut butter and oatmeal in a bowl? Put it in a microwave and eat it for breakfast? Unless I'm missing a brain cell, I think it's appalling to call this simple breakfast a recipe!! And very unhealthy to suggest I use a microwave to cook most of the meals!! Also there's lots of typing errors all over the place, as if it's been hastily copied and pasted. I had expected a lot more after reading all the positive reviews but I'm very disappointed, it seems you can't always trust what you see, if it looks too good to be true most of the time it isn't true. This is an okay book with average recipes nothing more than 1 or 2 stars.[EOS]

Therefore, I think you have to do your research, take any concerns in to consideration and then make the best decision for you and your baby.<br />Our daughter has been on this for 6 months now and is doing really well - she loves to drink this, is putting on an appropriate amount of weight and is healthy and happy.

[BOS]I started eating Manuka honey a couple of years ago when I was on a trip over to New Zealand.[SEP]This is  beautiful mild honey and I put it anything, so not overpowering - a real clean taste.[SEP]I started eating Manuka honey a couple of years ago when I was on a trip over to New Zealand. There were a lot of cool little honey shops spread throughout the country so I ended up tasting a lot of different regional honeys. Happy Valley was one of the honey shops that we stopped into. Most of the honeys we tried down there tasted pretty amazing and were full of health benefits.  We bought some of this and the Wildflower blend recently and they are just like the honeys I had when I was traveling over there.  It is really cool to see that I can get this without having to go all the way down to New Zealand. This is  beautiful mild honey and I put it anything, so not overpowering - a real clean taste.[EOS]

I have this on my front and a Kenda K838 Slick Wire Bead on the back. Part of it could be my fault though, the times I've ridden on hard pack I was inflated for the road @ 60 psi.

[BOS]I'm an idiot, a moron, am hopeless.[SEP]What a bargain![SEP]I'm an idiot, a moron, am hopeless. When it comes to picking out &#34;GIRLIE STUFF&#34;... Just ask my loving bride of over 35 years.  So when I saw this and I loved it, I KNEW it must be just awful. I had to try. She has spent 6 straight months nursing me after a LOT of &#34;stuff&#34; from surgical complications etc. She gave up 3 weeks of her vacation and a lot more to care for me tirelessly. I saw this and HAD to at least try. It was so affordable I knew it was something I could afford to lose money on if another failure.<br /><br />  To my amazement she LOVES this, and her love for it is genuine. When an old dingbat ..... oh wait....when my beloved little bride gets that &#34;look&#34; on her face, you know, the kind when she is going to cry and you PANIC but then pause since you soon realize it is going to be &#34;happy tears&#34;? Well that is what I got. I was tempted to tell her I loved her so much that all these precious diamonds were NOTHING compared to my love of her. But I figured I would get just about half of that out of my mouth before a plate would be flying across the room with my name on it:-)<br /><br />  So in reality, while I wish with all my heart that I COULD give her real diamonds and precious stones. I Wish I could give her everything in this world AND the next, whatever that may be. But I CAN give here this and tell her I love her and hope to be a better and more well hubby and that will have to do for now. In the meantime this earns a full 5 stars. It looks AMAZING for the cost and is an honestly very nice product that made my wife show me those big &#34;little girl&#34; eyes again for the first time in a long time. What a bargain![EOS]

I loved this bag, it is by far the nicest toiletry bag I have ever owned. I love the way that it opens up like the old fashion doctors bag, and stays open. The leather is nice and thick and looks as it should last me a life time, the leather has a kind of already used look but in a good way if you know what I mean. I think the size is perfect, you can fill it with full size bottles of shampoo, shaving cream or what ever. I also like the zipper bottom compartment. This is a great bag the only mistake you could make is NOT buying it.[EOS]

[BOS]I am a Keurig fanatic.[SEP]I don't need the extra always, but it's nice to have it and be able to add it accordingly without challenge.[SEP]I am a Keurig fanatic. The K-cups are a staple of my house. I find it very convenient especially in the morning because I am notorious for running late. K-cups make it really easy to measure and be on the run. Green tea is my favorite flavor and bigelow is amongst my favorite brand. I find these cups to be flavorful and not dull like so many alternatives. I also appreciate that it's not sweetened to death like some green teas.<br /><br />There are always those mornings where a little extra flavor can't hurt. Adding a dash of green tea powder {[[ASIN:B009PICJTS All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]} gives me the extra hit I'm looking for as well as a jolt of natural energy. I much prefer tea to coffee or other stimulants. Plus I don't have any crash which is always important. I don't need the extra always, but it's nice to have it and be able to add it accordingly without challenge.[EOS]

[BOS]This hatchet was not grouped with the high end hatches such as Estwing and others.[SEP]The price made this tool a steal.[SEP]This hatchet was not grouped with the high end hatches such as Estwing and others. The ratings of others were fairly high so I bought one. This was a very good move on my part. The hatches handle is made of strong composite material. Barely visible on the bottom of the ax head is a stamp that reads &#34;BV114 carbon steel.&#34; I'm not sure how much carbon is in the ax but it is well known that carbon steel is some of the best. The handle fits like it was custom made and has rubber grips. The blade is oversize; I believe 4 inches. It was fairly easy to get it razor sharp and it destroys small trees, fat pine logs for kindling and doubles as a tent stake/nail driver. This is one super hatchet and I highly recommend it. I simply cannot find any fault with it. It is manufactured in China, but so is the computer I'm using. The price made this tool a steal.[EOS]

[BOS]The saw arrives completely assembled.[SEP]All you need to do is slip some old newspaper or some rags or whatever under the saw when storing it and then check the oil level before the next use and you are good to go.[SEP]The saw arrives completely assembled. Included is a chain guard, a user manual and a wrench conveniently stored in the handle of the saw. The battery was not fully charged but nearly so and took a short time to bring it up to a full charge. All I had to do was add some bar and chain oil and the saw was ready to go.<br /><br />There have been a number of storms the past few months and they broke off numerous branches and downed one very large tree. I have been doing some cleanup with a Stihl gas powered saw and a 40 volt Ryobi. They do a fairly nice job on the branches but not so good on the big tree. I slipped on my goggles and hauled this bad boy out to the big tree.  I started of with the trunk size of about 14 inches. This saw was nothing less than amazing as it cut through the tree trunk like a hot knife through butter. I continued until the tree was cut up and then worked on some branches and some trimming. This saw never slowed down and the battery just kept on keeping on.<br /><br />This is now my saw of choice. No more mixing oil and gas for the Stihl and no more charging the battery for the Ryobi. From now on it is just charge the Greenworks battery and keep a supply of bar and chain oil on hand.<br /><br />Yes, this saw does dribble a bit of oil as did the Ryobi and as did every chainsaw I ever owned. That is no big deal. All you need to do is slip some old newspaper or some rags or whatever under the saw when storing it and then check the oil level before the next use and you are good to go.[EOS]

[BOS]We like this car seat cover a lot.[SEP]Useful and affordable, it's a small price to pay to keep your seats clean(er).[SEP]We like this car seat cover a lot. Our use case isn't very demanding -- we have a small car (Toyota Yaris) and a small dog (Jack Russell). Pet hair isn't much of a problem because his are thick little white hairs that are easy to remove with a lint roller, but it is nice having a cover over the seats to act as a barrier for wetness and dirt. The cover also doubles as a tarp for hiding boxes and items left in the back seat or hatch when we leave them in the car for storage or moving. When it gets dirty, it can be unfastened and scrubbed/hosed down.  Useful and affordable, it's a small price to pay to keep your seats clean(er).[EOS]

That being said, I feel like this one size fits all thing is not working, every time I keep finding myself pulling up the waist since it likes to sag down a bit. It has become very annoying since short skinny girls will not be able to do any good exercise like they want to. Forget about running, you will find yourself like one of those saggy pants guys that have no belts. The texture is okay but not great, surely not for the price. In the mean time I will be looking at other better designed leggings[EOS]

[BOS]Overkill--akin to protection for kids' tablets: That's exactly what's desired here by many.[SEP]A very safe bet for value 7&#34; tabs, with mini-HDMI.[SEP]Overkill--akin to protection for kids' tablets: That's exactly what's desired here by many. Beware: The purchaser may obtain exactly what they wish to obtain! Proximity sensor for  Kingpad K70 is covered--area at top of this needs tedious cutting out of the thick rubberized material--with scissors or an exacto/box cutter knife: Not an exact fit for K70, yet workable. Universal fit for many PRC-branded 7&#34; tabs. Cutout for USB and mini-HDMI exists, also.<br /><br />I protect the tab further with a screen protector and by putting everything everything into an old durable heavy synth-fabric zipper case, as well. Extreme rubberizing makes this product far heavier and bulkier than it may prove otherwise. Provides great protection--until I find something more suitable. May make pocketing, or even purse usage, somewhat more difficult.<br /><br />I'd prefer something thinner-skinned, also rubberized, which hugs the tablet better: This also is a little loose--never to the point at which the tab ever falls out, though. Somewhat difficult to remove the tab--no biggie. Material is so heavy, pulling it outward in order to remove the tab may prove a little more difficult than need be otherwise--no biggie. (It truly is thick and heavily rubberized--never rigid. It's &#34;springy&#34;--a very good thing.)<br /><br />This makes 7&#34; tabs somewhat more unwieldy, heavy, and bulky--even than before--not a good thing. Inducing further clumsiness, this even makes dropping the tab somewhat more likely. It should protect very well then, though--given that the screen doesn't hit something. Pushing buttons isn't as &#34;tactile&#34; as with thinner-skinned products. (The key moldings for such buttons do exist, though.)<br /><br />Maybe I'll leave &#34;skinning&#34; at this, in the end. Somewhat ambivalent, I feel very confident while handling the tab in its protection. A very safe bet for value 7&#34; tabs, with mini-HDMI.....[EOS]

It made the scratchy bits of my hands so soft on the first application. The dry winter air is killing me! What I really like about it the most is using it in my hair. I think it is important to know because of my hair type I am asian and my hair is long just past my waist. I am fanatical about having healthy hair even at the very bottom where as we all know is dead hair. Every time I wash my hair I apply the Argan Oil and I either blow dry it or let it air dry. Either way the oil absorbs beautifully into the cuticles of each strand. Having used this my hair is so much softer, silky and shinier!![EOS]

As I lengthen the pole, the black handle separated from the chrome pipe. I could not put the handle back securely. The other major issue was the two plastic molds where the tripod screwed came out of - SEE VIDEO.

[BOS]Sophie Winters is a drug addict.[SEP]Reviewed by Molly Horan on April 9, 2014.[SEP]Sophie Winters is a drug addict. Everyone knows that, but no one will believe that she's been clean for over six months, ever since her parents sent her to her aunt's for a tough love DIY rehab. But no matter what she says, no one believes the OXY pills--- the pills they found in her coat the night she and her best friend Mina walked into the woods together and only Sophie made it out alive --- aren’t hers. With everyone from her parents to Mina's brother believing that Mina was shot at a drug deal gone bad, it's up to Sophie to find the real motive and the real killer.<br /><br />But as she solves the case, Sophie has other issues to deal with, like the combined grief of her best friend's death and the knowledge that though they were both in love, Mina would have never agreed to be with her openly. Complicating things is her attraction to Mina's brother, who has always loved her and is responsible for the car accident that left her in permanent pain and led to her pill addiction. Joining forces with the strange but kind home-school kid who found her and Mina, Mina's ex-boyfriend and Mina's brother, Sophie begins to uncover the cold case that will lead her to solve two town murders.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is one part murder mystery, one part painful love story. Told in chapters that alternate between the present and the three most important times of her life --- the car crash, her pill addiction, and Mina's shooting --- it leaves plenty of mysteries unsolved until the final chapters. Sharpe does a great job as painting Sophie's love for Mina as another kind of addiction, an ever-present force in her life she could never really be free of, even as it was hurting her.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is a great book for fans of Veronica Mars, yet easily sets itself apart from the trend of YA murder mysteries with its unique love triangle and authentic voice of a teen dealing with addiction.<br /><br />Reviewed by Molly Horan on April 9, 2014.[EOS]

The main part of the bag opens nice and wide with its U shaped zipper opening. There are even handy smaller zippers on the outside of the bag which I love. It has a nice strap that you can connect that has extra padding on it. Also the smaller straps on it velcro closed. This bag would be so perfect to take with you to the airport. It is the right size and can be checked in. It is also perfect to keep inside the outside zipper of your main suitcase in case you go over the allowed weight. If you do, no problem, you can open up your Buddy Bag and then fill it up to be checked in as a second bag. This bag is great also for camping or weekend trips. It is good to store blankets or anything in also. I really love this product and my family and I will give it lots of good use![EOS]

[BOS]This film is high in camp value.[SEP]Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.[SEP]This film is high in camp value. The city is selling drugs to pre-teen kids in their community. Apparently the drugs are from the CIA who need money to fund secret wars, although this aspect is background to the street scene.<br /><br />Pastor Debra (Shirlee Knudson) is on a crusade to clean up the streets. With well choreographed moves we haven't seen since Pamela Grier and Teresa Graves braved them, she becomes a focal point for laughter. She is aided by the mysterious &#34;Fist&#34; (Leo Fong) who can stealthy moved through the city unnoticed due his slow motion swagger music and Father Guido Sarducci disguise. Fred Williamson helps out later as soon as his gig in the Philippines (camp martial arts movie capital) is completed.<br /><br />The film is packed with plenty of unintentional laughs as a martial arts drug dealing film is toned down to a &#34;Christian&#34; message movie. And just when you think the acting can't get any worse stunt man Ken Moreno appears on the screen reading lines.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.[EOS]

The features are really excellent, you can walk around the house doing laundry, vacuuming and cleaning while enjoying music (I usually stream Pandora or my Apple radio app) and the sound quality is loud and very nice. What I love most about this is when someone calls you, you can hear your phone ringing without knowing where your phone is to answer the call - just press the button on the side and boom you're talking to whoever called you. That's surely amazing and I haven't seen a feature like this. The other party just does not know I am on a headset and they are impressed every time I tell them. The range is also very good I can go around 30 feet and no loss of signal and quality.

[BOS]I received my first Tivo Series 2 as a gift, after a car accident over 10 years ago, in place of several VCRs I had around the house.[SEP]:-)[SEP]I received my first Tivo Series 2 as a gift, after a car accident over 10 years ago, in place of several VCRs I had around the house. It is still working like a champ! I have never had a single problem with it. It is still used every day. Since then I have talked my parents into getting two and my roommate into getting two. They couldn't live without them now. I currently have 3 units. It made things so much less painful after the accident, not having to go from one VCR to another and try to keep track of the tapes and shows. What a nightmare. I love that I don't have to keep up with any schedule, program and channel changes as well. Tivo recognizes any changes made and adapts from season to season. Thank you for making a product that I use every single day. Tivo kept me connected to the rest of the world for a long time. It still does. I tried going to a cable company's DVR (If you want to call it that) and it was horrible. The product and customer service was far from that of Tivo's. I paid over $300 less than two weeks later to get away from them. Tivo customer service is better than ANY electronic company I have ever dealt with. Even my dad, a tough man to impress, is extremely happy with your product, service and customer care. The capacities of units have come a long way from the first incarnation. Cable and satellite companies will be chasing, and never reaching, Tivo forever. Have a happy day. :-)  Thank you for making a quality product that gets better with each model. I am, and will be, a customer for life. :-)[EOS]

[BOS]I ordered this product at the same time that I ordered another Tactical Scarf.[SEP]Great product.[SEP]I ordered this product at the same time that I ordered another Tactical Scarf. It arrived as advertised. And I was thoroughly impressed with the material. 100% cotton, Measuring 42"x42" and the material felt twice as thick as the other scarf ordered. Made in India, and breathes SOOO well. Used it while making minor repairs on my 18 wheeler, and it proved an awesome wardrobe addition. I moistened it, and stayed cool in 107 degree heat. While I would love a 46"x46" size, due to me having a larger neck, and head. It will definitely be included in my clothing bag. After the first wash, It did not have any extensive color wash off. And the color stayed the same shade. I ordered purple, and will be definitely ordering a variety of colors. Giving 4 out of 5 stars. It would have been 5, but the 42"X42" size is going to prove to be an issue when I go for a complete head cover. Otherwise. Great product.[EOS]

The luminous part of the hand is at the tip, and this did not help much. The quality seemed good, and I do have another type of momentum. I cannot really give more that 2 stars because the purpose of a watch is to clearly see the time, and I could not with this model. It is a very poor design and the hands should be much more pronounced.[EOS]

[BOS]Pioneer Elite BDP-80FD
3D-Compatible Streaming Blu-Ray Disc Player
.[SEP]A nice step in the evolution of a universal entertainment device![SEP]Pioneer Elite BDP-80FD<br />3D-Compatible Streaming Blu-Ray Disc Player<br />. . . . .<br /><br />This device works quite well - easy to set up with a remote that's well laid-out and easy to understand. The big attraction is that the BDP-80FD has wireless Internet capability so you can connect your TV to your home wireless network and watch stuff on YouTube or other video sites on your bigscreen TV, as well as project photos or other computer projects. I can't comment on how much (if at all) using this device may make your private network vulnerable to hackers or the NSA, but it is a pretty cool feature. It is compatible with both standard DVDs and BluRay, and also has 3D capability, as well as the ability to play audio-only CDs, if you so desire. The HD video resolution is quite good, better than our previous DVD/BluRay player, with very vivid colors and sound. A nice step in the evolution of a universal entertainment device![EOS]

This case is indeed, beautiful but it has some design flaws that a cover/keyboard in this high price range should be addressed.  Firstly and most importantly... It is HEAVY!  The reason that many people buy an iPad Air is because of it's SUPER lightweight (1.5 lbs) design.  Adding this keyboard/case DOUBLES the weight to 3 lbs. You cannot turn the IPad into the portrait position and the clasp on the cover is metal and can hit and scratch your IPad screen.  The cover itself is beautiful and looks very professional.  I just can't honestly give this product any more than 3 stars due to the design flaws...[EOS]

[BOS]I chose to buy this case after having my Galaxy Note III for a week and a half with just a plain snap on case.[SEP]Samsung all the way.[SEP]I chose to buy this case after having my Galaxy Note III for a week and a half with just a plain snap on case. I read through all the reviews on this, and never doubted once that I would have issues with this product. So I went ahead and purchased the White S View case from amazon, with amazon prime shipping. Received it today and I IMMEDIATLY fell in love with how durable the case looks, and feels on my phone. I was really impressed with how firmly it snapped onto the back of my phone. I was slightly skeptical about that, since the back that comes on the phone seems to be flimsy once removed. The  case stays firmly shut after being flipped open for certain periods of time with ease.  Like the phone, the features it presents when the case is closed on the S View screen are fluid and distinct. It has everything I would need when not looking at the phone with the case open. I would DEF recommend this to anyone with a new note III, or who are considering getting this. I work for a bank and constantly have tons of keys floating around in my purse, I no longer have to worry about any surface of my new Galaxy Note 3 getting scratched just by simply tossing my phone into my purse. And answering a phone call without having to open it? How awesome is that?<br />GREAT BUY! I would buy this again in a heart beat. Beats all other brands of cases I looked at getting. Samsung all the way.[EOS]

Buy it, it's cheap and worth 5 to 10 bucks.  I have always been a fan of nice sword play and this game has it.  I really liked all the controls on this game.  You have pretty good control of the camera and although it can get tricky, I liked it.  I can see how some would say that it gets repetitive in the game with the missions, but I stuck with it and I am glad I did.  The landscape is excellent and just seemed to get better and better as the game went on.  The fights and assassinations really improved toward the end.  I heard that the second game is better and I can't wait to play it.[EOS]

I wanted something small and portable. This is that but unfortunately it just doesn't work.  Here are the major issues.<br />1. PC's often don't recognize the drive. I have to take it apart, pull out the mSATA, put it back in, put it back together and then PC's recognize the drive for about a day. Then it all happens again.<br />2. During data transfers over a few GB's it fails every time and the transfer stops.<br />3. Runs really really hot.<br />I bought a Sabrent enclosure and it works like a charm.  None of the issues I had with the Kingwin are issues any more. Thought it was my mSATA but that model has really good reviews and it's known to be super reliable.[EOS]

[BOS]This is a handy, well designed portable luggage scale.[SEP]This is a good value and I recommend the luggage scale.[SEP]This is a handy, well designed portable luggage scale.  It has a nice finish of chrome with a window that shows the weight of the luggage hanging below.  The window that shows the weight is offset so that you can hold the handle with luggage below and still read the weight.  The strap is a good length so that you can hold the luggage at a relatively normal height while weighing it.<br />The unit measures in g, Kg and pounds so it can be used internationally.  It is also useful for weighing any small or medium weight object that you may need to weigh if you can attach the object to the scale.  This is a good value and I recommend the luggage scale.[EOS]

[BOS]Swordfish has in my opinion one of the best openings to a movie I have ever seen.[SEP]Just sit back and log on, hack in, go anywhere, and steal everything with Swordfish.[SEP]Swordfish has in my opinion one of the best openings to a movie I have ever seen. The writing here is so superb, I think it should have been worthy of an Oscar nomination for John Travolta just for this scene alone. It introduces the character of Gabriel played by Travolta. At first you don't really know what is going on just that Gabriel is here starting to talk about Hollywood movies. As the dialogue progresses you begin to hear Gabriel discussing his distaste for movies lack of realism. He then moves into discussing the movie Dog Day Afternoon. And what would happen if Pacino really wanted to get away with the money he stole from the bank in the movie. Gabriel talks about what if Pacino started killing hostages left and right. How long would it take for the city to reverse is policies on hostage negotiation. It is then revealed that Gabriel has taken hostages and is in the middle of a bank heist of his own. Not to give too much more away for people who haven't seen Swordfish but the beginning ends with an amazing explosion that will rock your home theater system into overdrive along with some amazing visual photography.  The character of Gabriel is my favorite Travolta performance of all-time. He plays a character who is always many steps ahead of everyone else in the entire movie. Until the ending you never really know who Gabriel really is, only that he is a bad guy. And he's a bad guy you really like. You are always left guessing at what the motive is behind all of his actions, but he goes on to talk much about misdirection. Throughout the entire movie this is always a reoccurring theme to keep you guessing at what happens next.  The rest of the cast is absolutely perfect. Hugh Jackman plays the part of Stanley Jobson who is an computer hacker who no longer is allowed anywhere near a computer and is living in a trailer working a dead-end job. Halle Berry plays the roll of Ginger, who like Gabriel, as the movie goes on you never are too sure of who she really is. All that you are lead to know is that she is with Gabriel and her job is to bring Stanley in because Gabriel wants his computer skills for a job he needs done. Don Cheadle plays the role of J.T. Roberts who worked for the FBI and was the man who arrested Stanley and is the reason he is no longer allowed near a computer. Also following Stanley's arrest, Stanley lost custody of his daughter thanks to Roberts. Roberts now is now on the trail of Gabriel and the one trying to put together what Gabriel needs Stanley to do for him. Lastly, Sam Shepard plays the roll of Senator Reisman. I won't go too deep into what his roll is in the movie as it might give too much away to those who haven't seen it. Just know he plays a very important role.  I will say that action movies are by far my favorite type of movie and this movie is a perfect example of why. This movie features everything you will look for in an action movie; guns, car chases (with a beatuiful TVR Tuscan I might add), explosions, beautiful women, and even a bus dangling from a helicopter while flying through L.A. The movie also has a visual look to it that I can't put quite into words. It has some type of yellowish lens filter on some scenes and a cool blueish, purplish, greenish filter on other scenes. You really have to see it, it just gives the movie its own feeling that I have never seen before and I absolutely love it. And I never want another movie to use it because looking at it just reminds me this is Swordfish.  The other thing I must bring up is this films AMAZING soundtrack [[ASIN:B00005K2DI Swordfish]]. It was created by popular techno artist Paul Oakenfold. I have never heard a soundtrack like this in my life. It just fits the entire look of the movie so amazingly and will also give your home theater system a workout as well.  Finally I will talk about the Blu-Ray itself. The picture quality here is reference quality. Its that good. It also features a 5.1 Dolby Digital track which is a bit older than today's current DTS HD tracks but it still sounds very phenomenal.  Just sit back and log on, hack in, go anywhere, and steal everything with Swordfish.[EOS]

[BOS]There are so many companies making tempered glass.[SEP]Once you try Besgoods Tempered Glass you will use nothing else ever again.[SEP]There are so many companies making tempered glass. How do you choose? In doing my research I have discovered that one of the best choices is Besgoods. Their tempered glass is on the thinner size and while you may think that is not a good thing it actually is. It provides for a better fit in your iPhone 6 case, especially the cases with the built in battery packs.<br />You will get a HD ( high definition ) picture like none you have ever seen. The glass is rated 9H which is a very high rating for being scratch resistant. You will also see a big change since fingerprints and the oils they leave behind are a thing of the past.<br />The installation process is actually very easy but you must read the directions. You will find everything you need in the package. You start by cleaning off your phones screen with the wipe they enclosed, and then dry it. Then you line up the openings, and lay it down on the screen. You get no bubbles at all. If you need to move it you just carefully lift it off and do it again. There is no residue left behind. They did a great job with all the cutouts for the camera and everything else that made it easy to make everything line up.<br />You have to be crazy to use the old fashioned plastic sheets to protect your screen. They leave bubbles and don't protect your screen at all. Once you try Besgoods Tempered Glass you will use nothing else ever again.[EOS]

[BOS]The Lambda-Class Shuttle (a.k.a., Imperial Shuttle) is one of four "Wave 3" expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game.[SEP]Definitely take a look around online as you can often find these for less than $20 each with free shipping if you buy enough.[SEP]The Lambda-Class Shuttle (a.k.a., Imperial Shuttle) is one of four "Wave 3" expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game. I think there are several good reasons to add a couple of this ship to your Imperil fleet.<br /><br />As with the HWK-290, it should be kept in mind that the Lambda-Class Shuttle is mostly  a support ship (but, unlike the HWK-290 it is not almost solely a support ship and it definitely has some nice advantages of its own). It should also be noted that this is the only ship in Wave 3 that comes on a large base (which can make it a bit more difficult to maneuver).<br /><br />That said, the base stats for this ship range from poor to excellent overall, and include 3 attack dice (excellent for Imperials), 1 defense dice (the worst yet for an Imperial ship, but the lots of hull and shield will help make up for this), 5 hull (very good or better for Imperials), and 5 shields (excellent for an Imperial ship). All Lambda-Class Shuttles also have the focus and target-lock actions (making this the second Imperial ship without the evade action, and the Imperial ship with the least number of possible actions overall).  They can also be upgraded in several ways with a variety of previous and new modifications, including a crew upgrade.<br /><br />Second, you get 4 new pilots (including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities).  Pilots include:<br /><br />(1) Omicron Group Pilot, a level 2 non-unique pilot that costs 21 points.<br /><br />(2) Captain Yorr, a level 4 unique pilot that costs 24 points, who has a support special ability that reads, "When another friendly ship at Range 1-2 would receive a stress token, if you have 2 or fewer stress tokens, you may receive that token instead."<br /><br />(3) Colonel Jendon, a level 6 unique pilot that costs 26 points, whose support special ability reads, "At the start of the Combat Phase, you may assign 1 of your blue target lock tokens to a friendly ship at Range 1 if it does not have a blue targetlock token."<br /><br />(4) Captain Kagi, a level 8 unique pilot that costs 27 points, whose support special ability reads, "When an enemy ship acquires a target lock, it must lock onto your ship if able."<br /><br />Third, it also includes 12 upgrade cards (most of which is exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released): (1) ST-321allows an Imperial Shuttle (only) with this modification to acquire a target lock on any eligible ship on the board even if they would normally be considered out of range for a target lock; (2) Intelligent Agent -- a 1 point crew upgrade that allows you to look at the movement dial of one enemy ship at range 1-2 at the start of the activation phase; (3) Darth Vader -- a very interesting 3 point unique crew upgrade  that allows you to take 2 damage to cause a ship you just attacked 1 critical damage; (4) Navigator -- a 3 point crew upgrade that lets you change your maneuver dial to another maneuver with the same baring; (5) Weapons Engineer -- a 3 point crew upgrade that was also released in wave 2; (6) Rebel Captive -- a nice 3 point crew upgrade that requires the first ship to attack you during round to suffer one stress token ; (7) Flight Instructor -- a 4 point crew upgrade that lets you reroll one of your focus OR blank results depending on the defenders pilot skill; (8) Advanced Sensors -- an interesting 3 point upgrade that lets you do your action before rather than after you move, which will come in very handy if you think  you'll end up colliding with a ship or asteroid; (9) Heavy Laser Cannon -- a 7 point secondary weapon upgrade that was also included in Wave 2; (10) Sensor Jammer -- a very interesting 4 point upgrade that allows you to change one of the attackers hit results to a focus (and also prevents them from rerolling this focus); and (11) TWO copies of Anti-Pursuit Lasers - an awesome 2 point upgrade that lets you roll one attack dice against enemy ships that end by touching your base.<br /><br />As with all expansions, this one includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game (though a copy of the base set is still needed to play). In fact, another very interesting things about this ship is the maneuver dial... it is the first and only (as of the time this review was written) to include 0 movement (i.e., you can take a stress token and not move at all).  This will come in very handy if you want ships to crash into you so you can get free shots off with Anti-Pursuit Lasers.<br /><br />Given all the nice new things it adds to the Imperial side (especially the upgrades, many of which can be used with other ships), I think it is a very worthwhile addition to the game. I bought 2 for now, but could see owing up to 4 at some point depending on how they play over time. Definitely take a look around online as you can often find these for less than $20 each with free shipping if you buy enough.[EOS]

Shortly thereafter, I insert a new tape that I recorded on.

HBO has done a fantastic job at narrating such a complex story in a rather intricate way yet still keep a great flow to the narration. Kept my attention through the entire Season 1. Can't wait to watch Season 2. This is one of the few books where the movie/TV series has not disappointed those that have read the book.[EOS]

[BOS]The interesting thing is that I just finished reading the 50 Shades trilogy so reading this so quickly afterwards really showcased how superficial the 50 Shades series was and how deep this lovely novel is.[SEP]It may not be a book for everyone but the writing and intensity of the relationship was beautiful - and heartbreaking.[SEP]The interesting thing is that I just finished reading the 50 Shades trilogy so reading this so quickly afterwards really showcased how superficial the 50 Shades series was and how deep this lovely novel is. 50 Shades is like commercial candy and this book is like a finely made Swiss chocolate.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this. It began somewhat depressing, a woman feeling trapped in the routine and exhaustion of her married life with kids. Haven't we all felt somewhat downtrodden when our kids are young and we lose our way in cleaning up, feeding, and answering questions?<br /><br />But then it backtracks to her life in the Australian bush and as she begins to grow and blossom into puberty and feeling the power of her own sexuality she reaches out to others to test the power of her new found growth. Naivety puts her in some awkward situations (and as a parent, I found them rather scary) but she is also longing for the returned love of a man as her father has seemingly removed himself from showing signs of love and affection.<br /><br />And then she discovered an old house, seemingly abandoned, that becomes the setting for the biggest change in her life. A time of exploration, blossoming, lessons, love, reflection, growth, turmoil, soul searching and also what often holds her back from living the rest of her life with freedom and abandon.<br /><br />The fact that this is mostly about the relationship (and sexual growth and experimentation) between a young man and a teenage girl is certainly controversial but I don't think it was written to be a political stand on sex with a minor. We never really know her age but since she still has to go back to school at the end of her summer I assumed she was 16 or 17.<br /><br />The writing style is very different than a traditional chapter by chapter story unfolding since we always hear from the first person is snippets of short chapters with very little fill in.<br /><br />What was amazing was how wellit conveys the struggle a woman can go through with sexuality, the power behind it, and the deep emotional feelings that accompany that aspect of a woman. I was really pleased with where the story ended. Just right.<br /><br />It may not be a book for everyone but the writing and intensity of the relationship was beautiful - and heartbreaking.[EOS]

A bunch of frogs at a house do bad things.  Perhaps if Kermit was involved for a few laughs and some massive doses of gore and violence, it might make this better.

[BOS]Doctor King's organic Japanese matcha is fresh, green, smells great and tastes very good.[SEP]:)[SEP]Doctor King's organic Japanese matcha is fresh, green, smells great and tastes very good. For anyone that is new to matcha, here are a couple of my favorite matcha recipes.  To make a matcha latte, I sift one teaspoon or two grams of matcha onto 8 oz of hot milk (160 F). I blend the matcha and milk with a hand blender and pour it into a latte glass. Sift a little matcha on top. Lovely! It has a light bright green color and is delicious! Sometimes I make matcha tea with this matcha - it's quite nice. Unlike some others brands I've tried, Doctor King's matcha is not bitter.  I love smoothies. Here is how I make a Matcha Super Smoothie. I use organic vegetables and fruit. I put a handful of organic spinach, one stick of celery. some cucumber, water 4 oz, ice 4 oz, organic Japanese matcha 1/2 teaspoon, one kiwi fruit, one pear, one apple and a couple of berries into a blender. Blend until smooth. Serve in a glass. I say &#34;drink it and feel super!&#34;  I have taken a few pics. I took the pics in a glass in bright lighting. I find that if you look at the matcha in a darker part of the kitchen or in a mug, you don't see the color so well. This product is a very good buy. It is definitely worth trying! :)[EOS]

[BOS]I purchased the five set kabuki brush which I'm realizing now was a little overkill (how many kabuki brushes can you have?[SEP]Can't go wrong with this brush or this company.[SEP]I purchased the five set kabuki brush which I'm realizing now was a little overkill (how many kabuki brushes can you have?) but I was highly intrigued by the set and the companies dedication.    First impression. The packaging is great. The brushes come individually packaged and the brush holder all come in a box filled with pink confetti and a very cute sticker (that I won't spoil for you:), this would make a perfect gift for any makeup lover.  When I opened the bags for each brush they emitted and awful smell. Seriously they smelt awful which was an initial turn off. I immediately washed them my preferred way, with baby shampoo, and the smell was gone. I am still not fan of the idea that the brushes came loaded with chemicals but this is the only con.    The brushes are AMAZING. Incredibly dense and full yet incredibly soft and pick up makeup so well. These apply effortlessly and really give your skin an airbrushed look. So easy to use yet so effective. These brushes are far better than Sigma's kabuki though somewhat different, Sigma's have a slightly larger head and are fluffier however these are denser and equally as soft as Sigmas and I find the denseness gives a better application. I won't be using my Sigma again any time soon. These brushes also have a great weight to them. Very heavy duty wood handle with a sturdy metal ferrule, you can tell the quality just by holding them.    On top of this Beauty Junkees has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. When I received the kit the leather tube was too small to hold all the brushes and I was very confused. I contacted the seller who responded right away and said they had made their brushes denser which in return caused them to be larger and they no longer all fit in the tube. She told me they were in the process of making a new larger tube and offered to send me one when they were completed in a few months. Well during this time the seller kept me up to date on the production of their tubes andsure enough I received one via priority mail wrapped in pink tissue paper. This tube is perfect for holding all the brushes and is a beautiful leather and very very solid. Beauty junkees truly cares about their customers satisfaction and was extremely kind and prompt in their response. I have since bought several of their other products because I value their great quality and great customer service.    Can't go wrong with this brush or this company.[EOS]

[BOS]Copland was actually a pretty decent film over all but nothing to write home about.[SEP]Its a movie with a few embalances but it was pretty decent.[SEP]Copland was actually a pretty decent film over all but nothing to write home about. One thing I found interesting is that the central character is played by Silvester Stallone who portrays a local sherrif who wanted to be a city cop but couldn't pass the entrance requirements because he suffered hearing loss in one ear when he was a younger man. You would think he wouldnt make an interesting choice to play this role when you consider other oscar caliber actors like Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Harvey Kietel play major roles in this film. But as it turns out Silvester was the perfect choice to play this character and he did pretty good playing this guy. Another aspect I enjoyed was noticing all the actors that were in this film that were regulars on HBOs hit series, The Sopranos. Eddie Falco, Robert Patrick, Frank Vincent, Annabella Sciorra, Arthur J. Nascarella and a few others played major characters on the series. No doubt the casting directors of the award wining HBO series must have used this film as a reference when decided on who would be cast in roles in that series. After all the mafia plays a role in this film about police corruption that begins simple enough then escalates out of control. Its a movie with a few embalances but it was pretty decent.[EOS]

More importantly, it has an internal, rechargeable battery to backup the programming, so it's not lost in an outage.  It's not clear to me whether the battery can be replaced, so I hope that it lasts a long time.<br /><br />At first I was feeling pretty smug because it seemed that the programming was completely straight-forward.  'What were all those reviewers complaining about?' I thought.  Then I discovered that I had missed a programming step and had to do it again.  Humbled, I decided that I would ding my rating by one star because of the non-intuitive programming.  Also, either the daylight savings adjustment doesn't work or I haven't figured out the correct way to activate it.<br /><br />So Far, it's been reliable through numerous short and moderate outages.  I also like that it's designed so that it doesn't cover both outlet sockets.  I can still plug something else into the second socket.[EOS]

[BOS]Since becoming vegan, I have been on a quest to make my own soymilk yogurt.[SEP]Highly recommended.[SEP]Since becoming vegan, I have been on a quest to make my own soymilk yogurt. Soymilk yogurt does not thicken naturally the way that dairy milk yogurt does, so I have been searching for ways to make the yogurt less runny.  I wanted to find something that creates a pleasant consistency AND something that does not require extra work (such as stirring anything over a hot stove).  Agar agar powder, xanthan gum, and tapioca starch have all been experimented with numerous times with varying results.  None have produced a satisfactory consistency.<br /><br />I'm glad to report that my first experiment with Ultra Gel was a success and I plan to continue using this from now on.  I added 1/2 cup Ultra Gel along with 2 Tbsp sugar to 6 cups of my homemade (unsweetened) organic soymilk. I also added a packet of vegan starter (purchased from Cultures for Health) and incubated this at 110 degrees for 8 hours (then chilled it for 12 more hours in the Cuisinart Electronic Yogurt Maker with automatic cooling).  The yogurt was perfect, exactly what I was hoping for.<br /><br />Highly recommended.[EOS]

[BOS]I had been looking at players for sometime.[SEP]I hope this review was helpful![SEP]I had been looking at players for sometime. The LG, Panasonic, Samsung, and Sony offerings were all about the same price. LG http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BD7UVKI Panasonic http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00AYB3OMG Samsung http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00ICDAAXO Sony http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00U1SWZV8  I had minimal requirements: must play blurays, upscale DVDs, have optical or coaxial audio out, and 3d is preferred (simply because I wanted to test it out on my F8500 Plasma). http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BCPGOD4  This fit the bill.  My final two were the Samsung H5900 or this player. Both 3D, Both good reviews. At retail they were about evenly priced. I ended up getting this player for $64.99 Shipped. It is a fantastic player and I couldn't be more pleased.  I don't use the apps on it since my TV has them and I'm a rare HTPC user for 90% of my content. However, once I connected it to my network it did find some media on my desktop and I could stream it without even trying to. It had no issues streaming HD rips (10gb or so) via its connection.  I haven't had a single issue with any discs I've put into it. The interface is simple and functional, perhaps not the prettiest, but I could care less. Blurays look fantastic, the color really pops and the movies are crisp. It outputs 1080p/24p which my F8500 handles wonderfully. Completely smooth.  I do have one complaint, but I won't take off a star since the whole industry does this: For those of us with receivers and audio gear, keeping gear the same width and stackable has huge advantages, this unit replaced a full width Marantz DVD player, and its 7 inches smaller. Please bring back this style and not just at your top tier, the 7200 that has the audio gear case offers no benefits over the 6500 for $100 more.  I hope this review was helpful![EOS]

[BOS]If you're looking for a solution for an outdoor light that basically takes care of itself without the need of a mains electric power source then look no further![SEP]I'm going to be buying another one of these and I highly recommend them as a cheap option to solve your night time exterior light problems and also to add a dash of security to areas of your property.[SEP]If you're looking for a solution for an outdoor light that basically takes care of itself without the need of a mains electric power source then look no further! Once activated and put in place, this light offers an ample amount of light for highlighting those areas which are a little too dark when the sun goes down. I ordered two of these and have one right above my front door (for finding my keys that bit easier when I arrive home), and also one by my gate (so anyone coming in at night has some light to illuminate the path to the door). Let's also not forget they are a good security option for informing you of people approaching when put out of arms reach. The light gives off a dim glow throughout the night and switches to a really bright LED option when the motion sensor picks up movement. The light then turns back to it's dim setting around 10 seconds after. Perfect! The best part about these is their green energy efficiency where they charge throughout the day via the solar panel on the top of them. I'm going to be buying another one of these and I highly recommend them as a cheap option to solve your night time exterior light problems and also to add a dash of security to areas of your property.[EOS]

[BOS]This is the largest but still practical Swiss Army Knife in existence to actually use.[SEP]This is the ultimate knife system.[SEP]This is the largest but still practical Swiss Army Knife in existence to actually use.  The insert from the packaging states 80 tools for collectors, but I consider this knife to be a user.<br /><br />Unlike the other Swiss Army Knives which have a Matte or Glossy finish, this has a textured, clear red scale.  This features two electronic components, the LED LIGHT and the Digital Clock, timer, altimeter, barometer and alarm.<br /><br />For daily use, this have almost every practical tool imaginable.  A pen, knife, bottle opener, screwdriver, Torx set, ruler, tweezers, magnifying glass, scissors, wire cutters, pliers, wire splitter and splicer, pen, and filer.<br /><br />Sure you can get multiple different tools but what else has the flair of being all on the same gadget?  This is the James Bond version of the Swiss Army knife and I realize he was Scottish.<br /><br />There aren't many things that you cannot do with this.  Well, you can start a fire with the magnifier.  But, it won't change a tire for you.  These types of gadgets will have some limitations.  Whether you're hiking, hunting, camping or just around the house, this will serve so many daily purposes that you will wonder how you lived without it.<br /><br />This knife system as a whole is beefy and thick.  It's as wide as an iPhone but thicker.  It's almost 1 pound in weight.  Sure, you can put it into your pocket but at this kind of price, you might as well splurge for a holster.<br /><br />This can easily fit into a hunting backpack, fanny pack, cargo pants pocket, Murse/Manpurse or woman's purse.<br /><br />The construction is solid and it is backed by a strong warranty.  Replacement parts can get expensive if you lose stiff continuously over time.<br /><br />Sure, the cost is about the same as a high end handbag, decent watch, a good set of large Bluetooth speakers, or a nice set of binoculars, but the function really surpasses just the novelty of a knife system like this.<br /><br />There aren't any other gadgets that can do so much for you at this price point...especially, at the expense of size and practicality.<br /><br />This is the ultimate knife system.[EOS]

I have sensitive ears and worried about having silver backs, but my ears were fine and didn't seem to get irritated from them. The cell phone bling is perfect and adds so much style to my phone. It also protects the headphone jack from getting anything in it. The bracelet is gorgeous. It shuts very easily and there is no worry about a clasp with this item. It stays on securely. The necklace chain seems to be just the right amount of length. Clasp on the necklace is easy to open and closes nicely. It seems durable as it hasn't broke yet and I have worn this for over a week daily to check. I have also messed with it as well. The chain is really dainty but hasn't ripped and I am pretty notorious with doing that. The charm is brilliant. It shimmers and shines and the gem seems to catch the light at all the right angles. This is a cute set.[EOS]

I've never dealt with tights before (only leggings) so I don't know if that's normal.<br /><br />Overall, I'm still gonna keep them because they look good and I like them but I will have to be careful of the length of my tops and maybe figure out way to not have them be so sheer.<br /><br />I give them a 3.5[EOS]

[BOS]The BELLA Programmable Slow Cooker lets you choose the temperature (High, Low, or Warm) and the time (from 30 minutes to 20 hours, in 30 minutes increments).[SEP]It is actually a rich deep red, not quite a brick red but leaning that way.[SEP]The BELLA Programmable Slow Cooker lets you choose the temperature (High, Low, or Warm) and the time (from 30 minutes to 20 hours, in 30 minutes increments). However, it does not automatically switch to Warm when the High or Low time has expired.  So you need to be home at the end of the cooking time.<br /><br />I have used this for one recipe so far, and the chicken was done just right.  So I think the temperature must be about the same as other slow cookers.<br /><br />The controls are quite simple.  The instructions in the booklet don't match the actual device (the book refers to a non-existent "Time" button), but you really don't need instructions.  Just pick the temperature and pick the number of hours, and then it starts.<br /><br />I think this slow cooker is more attractive in real life than in the picture.  It looks like a cheap, bright red in the picture.  It is actually a rich deep red, not quite a brick red but leaning that way.[EOS]

This lens is the closest you can come to the latter control in a 35mm format, and it is short enough to even provide useful T/S control on APS-C format digital cameras where it would be the equivalent of the formerly shortest  'traditional' tilt-shift lenses on so-called &#34;full-frame&#34; cameras.<br /><br />The other makers will eventually equal this, I suppose, but for now, this is the king of its class.[EOS]

Their nut had a built-in shoulder, but adding washers to both sides insured neither the bolt head or nut would slide into the adjustment slot.

[BOS]I got these for my 2 year old daughter.[SEP]I'm going to order a 2nd pair to keep in the car.[SEP]I got these for my 2 year old daughter. They fit snugly and the ear part is very comfortably padded. They're adjustable and lock in place on the adjustment you choose.

She's always on her Zoodles &#34;Kid Mode&#34; app on either my or my husband's phone or tablet . It's a great, educational app with songs, video storybooks, etc. It keeps her quiet & engaged but in doctors offices, the car, church, the market or even while we're watching tv at home.....we have to listen to her shuffle through the app content. Not any more! These have worked wonders. The only flaw to me is the cord. I like that it's only on one side but it still gets in the way a little. They'd be 100% flawless if they were cordless.

[BOS]Buying a travel system can be confusing.[SEP]The click-connect is really nice and we can use the old bases we have.[SEP]Buying a travel system can be confusing. I went to Graco's website and still had a hard time telling why some cost more than others and I always find that it's something silly like adjustable height for the handle or something.  I have this system [[ASIN:B00ASI748K Graco FastAction Fold Click Connect Travel System/Click Connect 30, Finley]] to compare to.    So what do you get?  A car seat.  A base for the car seat.  A stroller.    The stroller is going to have the most feature difference between all the travel systems.  This stroller has one hand closing system. There is a button in the middle of the handlebar of the stroller that you push. Turn the the handle (where the button is attached) and then let go. Then you can use the same hand to pull the tray towards you and it closes. And it stays upright.    I can't open it one-handed though.    The other Graco system I mentioned above had the handle in the base of the stroller that you pull and and it folds (almost lifting it). I like this one better.    This system has locks for the front wheels if you don't want them to swivel (manual mentions grass).    The storage area is bigger on this system.    The base is different also. The old base I have has a bubble-level to get the seat in the car at the right angle. The problem with that is that there is so much leeway that it was useless.    This system does away with the bubble and has a red line on the base that must be level with the ground. I would get a level and hold it against that red line.    The car seat is good (and pretty much the same as other snugrides) and highly recommended from multiple sources.    The click-connect is really nice and we can use the old bases we have.[EOS]

[BOS]This review is for the 31&#34; Long Curly Gold Yellow Wig

Free product provided for evaluation and review.[SEP]I recommend them for us with this wig.[SEP]This review is for the 31&#34; Long Curly Gold Yellow Wig<br /><br />Free product provided for evaluation and review.<br /><br />Wow, this wig is gorgeous.  It is a very nice sunny blond.  It should work for blond yellow cosplays.<br />It is nice and full, and the wig-cap inside it is tightly woven and lace at the crown, making it an easy wig to sew into if that treatment is needed for a costume. I also like that they made the interior a light beige and that really helps it look more natural. It does adjust inside.<br /><br />The hair is quite natural looking - my natural blond hair is in picture beside it - it compares very well to natural hair, it is just a bit shinier.<br />It’s easy to comb and work with.  The waves are loose and the cut is long layers, which give it some added volume.<br />It can be styled with setting lotion and a hairdryer on cool or no heat, or set and curled and left to dry.  It has retained it’s out of box waviness well for me.<br /><br />It should fit most adults.  It fits me perfectly and I am a cap size MEDIUM with a head diameter of 22.5.”  It would stretch a bit more if needed.  It does have straps so it will adjust down to about a 21”.  I think any smaller than that would need a smaller long wig.<br /><br />It can be pinned if needed as the hair is a bit weighty from length, but generally it stays on very well, but it might need a few pins if you plan on being active.  That’s normal for long wigs. You’d want to use blond ones with this wig.  The bangs cover the hairline well.<br /><br />As I mentioned, it is a bit weighty in the back from length - blonde bobby pins will help secure it if needed.  I recommend them for us with this wig.[EOS]
[BOS]I got the Crane Drop Humidifier for Christmas primarily for my house plants.[SEP]I plan on trying to returning it as soon as I feel up to it.[SEP]I got the Crane Drop Humidifier for Christmas primarily for my house plants. I followed the instructions and it worked very well during its initial test run.  Five days later I now have the flu. I woke up this morning with an incredibly soar throat and a cough. I was hoping my new humidifier would would improve my condition. Unfortunately it no longer emits any mist. I followed the trouble shooting guide found in the instructions manual multiple times to no avail. I plan on trying to returning it as soon as I feel up to it.[EOS]

[BOS]As soon as I saw these filters existed, I got this one to keep in the car for emergencies, and I got the Point Zero Two Bucket system for home.[SEP]My thinking is, with new strains of virus' emerging all the time, this is just an added layer of &#34;insurance&#34;.[SEP]As soon as I saw these filters existed, I got this one to keep in the car for emergencies, and I got the Point Zero Two Bucket system for home. I already have two Katadyn filters.. one is a portable pump and the other a gravity fed system. Both are rated for a max of 40,000 gallons if I remember correctly. Those two filters would now cost about $400. They are still excellent filters systems. But for size, price  AND volume these Sawyer Filters can not be beat. I think this new filter technology will forever change the industry.. Now, there are many reviews of how these filters performed in actual situations. Some say they have not worked up to their needs. I cannot comment on how they work for camping etc. These comments of those who have used them, are factors to be taken into consideration according to your needs. In the right conditions and set up, these filters could literally last a lifetime. Since CLEAN / Purified WATER is one of the critical needs for survival, These filters should be part of everyone's emergency preparations.<br /><br />Please note - There are Sawyer &#34;Filters&#34; for bacteria/ parasites and &#34;Purifiers&#34; which also will filter out virus'.  I returned the &#34;Point One&#34; FILTER system, because I wanted the &#34;Point Zero Two&#34; viral protection as well. My thinking is, with new strains of virus' emerging all the time, this is just an added layer of &#34;insurance&#34;..[EOS]

[BOS]This is actually a beautiful piece, especially if you have a guy who usually prefers a sports watch but sometimes needs a dress watch for dressier occasions.[SEP]But for the value, it's not a constant problem and not one that would make one set aside the watch in favor of another in our opinion.[SEP]This is actually a beautiful piece, especially if you have a guy who usually prefers a sports watch but sometimes needs a dress watch for dressier occasions. This one won't break the bank, but it has a look of a far pricier watch than it actually is for those occasions.<br /><br />Better yet, it comes with 2 band colors both in leather: tan and black so you can easily match one's belt and shoes with accessorizing the watch for the evening or day as well.<br /><br />I personally prefer a watch with an all gold band if worn daily so that you don't have to wear out the band taking it on and off for showering or swimming, but for that occasional dressy outing, this works perfectly.<br /><br />The face being a skeleton of the watch creates a more stylish and interesting look for the piece of jewelry and quite frankly if you are a woman who loves a large watch, it can flow both ways just because of the beauty of the piece. The fancy box it comes in equals the look of the watch.<br /><br />That said, I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned it being difficult to read at times. I find the same problem and concur. The hands being small and the cut out making dark areas of the watch, they often blend in together and can cause reading the hand incorrectly.<br /><br />But for the value, it's not a constant problem and not one that would make one set aside the watch in favor of another in our opinion.[EOS]

[BOS]In December of 2012 my AST was 65.[SEP], or from dieticians and (most) doctors.[SEP]In December of 2012 my AST was 65.  After adding cinnamon to my diet to reduce blood sugar (which it did dramatically), in June 2013 my AST was 127.  Since I am on niaspan and livalo, my doctor suspected they may have caused the elevated readings.<br />I just randomly happened upon nutritionfacts.org after that office visit, and browsing through articles, noticed<br />[...]  Here's a partial transcript:  The use of cinnamon to help treat diabetes remains controversial. We know that cinnamon is so good at controlling one's blood sugar that you can cheat on a diabetes test by consuming 2 teaspoons of cinnamon the night before your glucose tolerance test. Basically they make you drink some sugar water and see how well your body can keep your blood sugar levels under control, and if you eat those two teaspoons right when the test starts or 12 hours before you can significantly blunt the spike. A half teaspoon doesn't seem to be enough… but about a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference. A review of the best studies done to date found that the intake of cinnamon by type 2 diabetics or prediabetics does lower their blood glucose significantly. So what's the controversy? Cassia cinnamon, also known as chinese cinnamon, or probably what you're getting at the store if it just says cinnamon contains a compound called coumarin which may be toxic to the liver in high enough doses.  For little kids, just a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon a few times a week may be too much, and a teaspoon a day of cassia cinnamon might be too much for anyone. Nearly all of the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been done on cassia. Research shows blunting of blood sugars in response to cassia cinnamon, but in response to Ceylon cinnamon, nothing.<br />Google Korintje liver to see lots of warnings, but you will not see any on the product description here, or on general nutrition advice websites, or from dieticians and (most) doctors., or from dieticians and (most) doctors.[EOS]

[BOS]Julianne Hough is Katie, a young woman on the run from her past.[SEP]After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.[SEP]Julianne Hough is Katie, a young woman on the run from her past. Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus, and gets off impulsively at Southport, a beautiful coastal town in North Caroline. There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.<br /><br />“Safe Haven” is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse Hallström (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance “Dear John” a few years ago), “Safe Haven” is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.<br /><br />For “Safe Haven” attempts to be a “mystery” – in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katie’s neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.<br /><br />The film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it. After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.[EOS]

[BOS]It's okay.[SEP]Nice bag for a college student, but not a bag I could see an Executive using.[SEP]It's okay. Here's why. Although it offers a lot of roomy pockets, it really only works as a day/work backpack whereas I was hoping it could be used for short trips.<br /><br />The design is very linear. The back zipper portion would fit a fairly large laptop easily. The middle zipper section is really only good for long and tall things - books, documents, folders. You cannot comfortably fit clothes or weekend wear without the bag becoming really bulky just via its design.<br /><br />Front zipper pocket provides a space that is highly organized and then there are two larger just buttoned pockets that would be great for a book or notepad.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this bag for its functionality but wish it was a little more travel friendly. I also would go with a different color than khaki if the choice, khaki is exactly as it appears in the photo which really looks a lot more like military camo green.<br /><br />Nice bag for a college student, but not a bag I could see an Executive using.[EOS]

I hope I could help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did![SEP]I got this hoping to get a decent set at home but it didn't turn out that way. First, the smell of this set is nothing short of toxic. The chemical smell they come with is nauseating and fills an entire room. I tried wiping them down but it didn't seem to help and after some inspection noticed there was a warning label about the chemicals used being linked to cancer and birth defects. Also, the kit doesn't even come with enough weight to even reach 40 lbs. I weighed all the weights and they equal 38 lbs, which is with the 4 lb bar itself.<br /><br />After getting rid of these I got myself a set of dumbbells I absolutely love. I got them around a month ago and I can't find a single thing to complain about. The max weight and combination of weights included are endless. I'm so happy I bought the set.<br /><br />If you want a quality set of dumbbells, then get the same set I did here on Amazon ---------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r0BiNN<br /><br />I hope I could help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did![EOS]

Removed the drivers that auto installed, and installed these.  When I plugged in the cord windows attempted to update but I halted it(a selection popped up to do so).  I can now read/write without the radio in TX.

[BOS]This trainer helps drill ball players mainly in hand/eye coordination.[SEP]All in all, a usable product.[SEP]This trainer helps drill ball players mainly in hand/eye coordination. It does not replicate pitching like a pitching machine but it does a fair job of reproducing soft toss with several variations built in. Overall this is bigger than it looks in the picture. The tubes have a disconcerting way of coming loose now and then, and the height adjustment knob should not be made of this kind of flimsy plastic, but otherwise it works as advertised. The dispensing of the ball onto the rebound net offers some element of unpredictability as the ball does not always bounce up to the same extent and direction. I suppose that is good. It is hard to draw a correlation from a scientific viewpoint but my kid has been using this for two weeks and the last few games have been a bit more productive for him after being on the machine. He has hit some pretty good line drives lately. I would like to think it is extra practice afforded by this machine, but the verdict is still out. All in all, a usable product.[EOS]

[BOS]I used this blade to cut aluminum frames that were 1 inch wide by 7/16 inch deep in various lengths.[SEP]Thanks Freud for making a excellent blade.[SEP]I used this blade to cut aluminum frames that were 1 inch wide by 7/16 inch deep in various lengths. The frames were used to make solar screens that reduce the amount of heat that radiates into the house created by the window glass , thereby, reducing the cost of cooling the rooms affected. The blade made a very smooth, clean mitered cut. I could have used a hacksaw and miter box, but I had 40 cuts to make, and doing it by hand was going to take more time and effort than necessary. This was my first time making solar screens, and using this blade assisted me in doing a really good job. I finished screens for 10 windows in a day. They are up and secured; they look professionally made and really do reduce substantially the transfer of radiated heat into the rooms. Thanks Freud for making a excellent blade.[EOS]

[BOS]This broke after two days of use.[SEP]Saves me tons of space in my trash can, but ultimately the can is heavier as there are more cans in it since they fit better crushed.[SEP]This broke after two days of use. The grip on the handle is just thin foam with a bar that goes through it into a hole on either side of the handle. Originally, the little bar had some flange style stuff going on so that the bar for the grip wouldn't fall off. Those wore away very quickly (I drink a lot of canned seltzer water) and soon the bar fell out which makes the two opposing pieces of the handle separate and go all wonky and uncoordinated. The Good News!: I put the bar in it's rightful place and wrapped the handle (leaving enough room for my hand to move around on the grip as the fulcrum force is applied) with packing tape very tightly and it has since been working like a dream. I love it now. Saves me tons of space in my trash can, but ultimately the can is heavier as there are more cans in it since they fit better crushed.[EOS]

[BOS]I have had this vacuum about a month and I use it 2-3 times a week.[SEP]That said, I purchased it for a super deal on Black Friday - for much less than retail or the price here on A.  If I was going to spend that extra hundred dollars to spend that much, I would do research to make sure the vacuum does great on hard floors, great on steps, and maybe has a bigger canister.[SEP]I have had this vacuum about a month and I use it 2-3 times a week.  We have five in our family and a dog.  Every time I use it I am amazed (and disgusted!!) by how much it picks up.  It is absolutely amazing!  Unfortunately, it makes me want to get rid of our dog because of all the dog hair - ugh!<br /><br />The things I like:<br />Not near as loud as our old vacuum<br />Very movable/pushable<br />Awesome suction<br />Canister is easy to empty<br />It vacuums the wood floors good enough (not great or perfect, though)<br />Headlights on the front<br />The handle is easy to recline by simply placing a light foot on the bottom while you pull the handle down (I don't know why that seems so much simpler than pressing a separate button with your foot like my old one, but for some reason I like it)<br />Using the stick part is easy - just push a button and it pulls out which makes it simple to get the corners and edges.<br />Automatically adjusts to different floor heights<br /><br />Cons:<br />The two on-board tools fall off constantly and so they got thrown in a cupboard - which makes them almost useless.<br />Doesn't seem to have one side of the vacuum that gets a closer edge.<br />Canister is small - because of the dog hair I have to empty it about 2-3x if I vacuum the whole house, but it is very simple so not a big deal<br />There is a roller attachment that is ok on the stairs but I was not hugely impressed with it<br /><br />In the end, I do really like this vacuum! I definitely recommend it and I am glad I made this purchase.  That said, I purchased it for a super deal on Black Friday - for much less than retail or the price here on A.

[BOS]These work perfectly for my application.[SEP]We'll see how long they last.[SEP]These work perfectly for my application. We have one single pocket door and one double pocket door. Putting one on each side of the double door allows access from either side of the door, which is nice.<br />So far, the glue has held strong, and the locking feature (so that the door can be opened freely) is nice.<br />My only issue with them is that while unlocked, and opening the door, the fins ride along the inside of the pocket door and make a squealing noise. When closing the door, they don't make any noise, and if the lock is disabled, of course they make no noise. For now they deserve a full rating. We'll see how long they last.[EOS]

[BOS]I used this on my kitchen counter which is white ceramic tile with thin white grout.[SEP]I would absolutely recommend this.[SEP]I used this on my kitchen counter which is white ceramic tile with thin white grout. The grout has yellowed and always looks dirty, even after I bleach it, so this product was perfect. First I thoroughly I cleaned my tile. This is completely essential. Then I just rubbed the applicator along the grout lines like shoe polish. The product's consistency and effect is almost exactly like shoe polish, actually. It's just a white stain that covers the discolored grout. There is no strong odor to worry about. I waited a couple of hours then just took a damp cloth to rub off the excess that was on my tile and now all of the yellow is gone.  Some of the darker stains on the grout required a couple of coats, but that was no bother. My whole kitchen looks cleaner now. I would absolutely recommend this.[EOS]

The post here on Amazon is legit and the details are well cited.<br /><br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00IIB4YVE<br /><br />After purchasing a used unit and not being able to figure it out, I visited, in my local region, two libraries at two major universities. One was the library at the University of Wisconsin in Superior, WI and the other was the library at the University of Minnesota in Duluth, MN. I spoke with about ten students in each library and asked if they could help. All of them said &#34;&#34;No. I thought that maybe from talking to the students someone could enlighten me about the benefits of the unit. Finally I did some research online that helped answer my questions.<br /><br />If I could give 4 1/2 I would have. It does what I'm looking for, it's not 100% perfect but it's pretty darn good!

[BOS]I purchased this lens for my wife as a Christmas present on Nov.[SEP]Later update---ended up returning this lens anyway--my wife was not happy with it's performance and I was not happy with Nikon's wishy washy reply to my complaint.[SEP]I purchased this lens for my wife as a Christmas present on Nov.16,2012 and after she opened it I decided to register the lens for the extended 4 yr. warranty which was included. I am dismayed and shocked that the paper work explicitly states several times that the warranty is invalid if the product is not registered within 10 days of purchase. This seems like some sort of scam that Nikon is using to weasel out of honoring the offered warranty. It remains to be seen if Nikon will stand behind this offer or not but I am very unhappy that the registration period is so short. So be warned, if the extended warranty is important to you, make sure you register as soon as you receive the lens.<br /><br />UPDATE--to Nikon's credit, I received a prompt reply to my email questioning whether they would honor the extended warranty--message follows--<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Nikon. I do apologize for any inconvenience. Our Nikkor lenses comes with an additional 4 year warranty. In order to receive the additional 4 year warranty, you must register the lens as well as maintain the proof of purchase if any issues occur with the lens. Since it was a gift, if any issues occur and you need to send your camera to our service center, we recommend you state that in a brief description."<br /><br />no mention of the 10 day requirement here so why put it in the official paperwork?  I guess we will see in a few years.<br /><br />Later update---ended up returning this lens anyway--my wife was not happy with it's performance and I was not happy with Nikon's wishy washy reply to my complaint.[EOS]

[BOS]It lacks content.[SEP]At full price - 2.5/5 stars.[SEP]It lacks content. This game, while fun, is just not worth full price.<br /><br />I hated my:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00KME8K9C<br /><br />No fanboy can deny that. Single player starts off ok before devolving into a check the block COD knock off. The arrest mechanic, while fun at first, gets repetitive since bad guys react the same way every time. AI is just awful. But hey, who plays battlefield for single player, right? Hotwire and heist multiplayer modes are great. Conquest mode is neutered without attack helicopters and tanks. Sure it's a cops and robbers game, but if you are going to throw in a classic mode than Visceral/DICE shouldn't have been so lazy about it. They could have themed it to allow for the fun stuff. After all, they have tanks and attack choppers in the campaign. The few 5v5 modes are not worth your time as Counter-strike does them better. There are a few balancing issues and bugs that need to be ironed out, but overall it runs well. There is hardly any destruction outside of levolution events, which kind of makes sense so that people may use the grappling hook and a few other gadgets, but it's still a disappointment none the less. My biggest gripe is the overall lack of content. EA promised us that Hardline would have the same amount of content as BF4. That was a lie. You only get a few guns per class. Take the enforcer class for example, you get to choose between 2 shotguns or 2 medium range rifles. If you don't like any of those then you are sh$% out of luck. Same thing goes for pistols and for some reason they are locked to certain classes. Why can't I carry a Beretta or glock in the mechanic class? It seems to me like they stripped a lot of content to later sell as DLC, which is what this game should have been... themed DLC. While I cannot recommend at full price, I do recommend it if you can get it for $30 or less. Or just skip it all together since BF4 is running great and better titles are coming out this year. At full price - 2.5/5 stars.[EOS]

[BOS]I too am an avid baby wearer and this car seat carrier has NOTHING to do with baby wearing.[SEP]Duh.[SEP]I too am an avid baby wearer and this car seat carrier has NOTHING to do with baby wearing.  This car seat carrier is for carrying your baby, in an infant car seat, to and from places where you would not bring a stroller or carrier (e.g. a restaurant, friends houses).  Even a short two-three minute walk from a parking space to your destination can be very difficult while lugging a heavy and cumbersome car seat.  The seat bangs against the side of your leg, makes it very difficult to carry diapers bags or other things, and limits your ability to help your other kiddos (if you have them).  I did not have this car seat carrier with my first two babes and I can still remember, VERY CLEARLY, the dreaded infant car seat days.  I am so excited to have it with my third child!!!  And yes, I will be wearing my baby tons and no I won't be walking around with the car seat hanging off of me for long walks or visits as some reviewers have suggested.  Duh.[EOS]

[BOS]Steele's work on stereotype threat is excellent![SEP]and, how people may be conveying stereotype without even realizing it (or intending to).[SEP]Steele's work on stereotype threat is excellent!  I have read and researched almost all of his work in academic journals. A few people recommended this book to me over the years, but I never thought to buy it because I was so familiar with his academic publications. However, this past summer, I decided to give a try for my self-imposed &#34;summer reading&#34;.  It was a good read and the departure from &#34;academic writing&#34; was nice.  I didn't learn anything new, but enjoyed it nevertheless.  If you are familiar with Steele's work, you won't get anything new from it.  But, if you are new to Steele's work, then this is an impressive, thought-provoking read.  In my opinion, his research is necessary in understanding how stereotypes impact us in ways that most people may not realize..and, how people may be conveying stereotype without even realizing it (or intending to).[EOS]

There is also a button at top to keep your hood on and a zipper pocket for more storage use. These are super handy if you don't want to wear a small bag to an event or for just staying warm. XD[EOS]

[BOS]The quality and taste of this green tea is phenomenal.[SEP]Highly recommended if you like Green Matcha tea.[SEP]The quality and taste of this green tea is phenomenal. I love making a cup of this tea for breakfast-- it is soothing and tastes good. It's also good after dinner, to help relax and de-stress. This tea is organic and non-gmo, carefully prepared and packaged. I really appreciate the fact that it does not contain pesticides. It is pure and clean, with a mild green flavor. I dont add any sugar or sweetner to my hot tea, although some people like it sweet. To create a frappe, I mix it with coconut milk and ice cubes in the vitamixer. Highly recommended if you like Green Matcha tea.[EOS]

[BOS]I had high hopes for this movie.[SEP]Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something.[SEP]I had high hopes for this movie. Winona Ryder's in it, after all. But those hopes were quickly dashed once I got into this corny and very stupid movie. Our hero, a rather studly guy played by Simon Baker, gets an e-mail with the names of all the girls he's been to bed with and all the ones he is going to bed. However, he's just about to tie the knot. Now if you were a stud would you get married, if you all of a sudden knew you were going to bed a gaggle of gals in the very near future?<br /><br />Winona plays Death Nell, a goth girl who goes around putting guys to sleep. She give them a potion and they go into a coma. Well, she inadvertently kills one. Naturally she's the last girl on the list and Mr. Stud doesn't want to go there, but can he help himself, can he quit taking good looking hotties to bed, even if he wants to? That is the question and that question is so silly that you might want to give this movie a pass. Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something.[EOS]

[BOS]The idea of the vacuum is very good.[SEP]Overall, a good idea, but needs some improvements in material quality and engineering to be a great vacuum.[SEP]The idea of the vacuum is very good. It's nice to be able to have the extra suction power when needed to vacuum hairs from carpets.  The execution however was not so impressive. It would be more convenient to have a vacuum that picks up what is needed automatically, rather than having to push another button.  The materials used feel cheap and the cables fall when pushing the vacuum.  When I initially pushed the button, the roller didn't work and my husband had to adjust it to get it to work. The automatic rewind worked well initially, but then required that I hold the cable to help feed it.  Overall, a good idea, but needs some improvements in material quality and engineering to be a great vacuum.[EOS]

[BOS]This lightweight travel duffel bag from BAGO was an instant hit in our household.[SEP]Go for it.[SEP]This lightweight travel duffel bag from BAGO was an instant hit in our household. Our daughter grabbed it as soon as it arrived, unpacked and unfolded it, stuffed in some of her clean laundry (she was home from college and brought laundry home to wash...) and packed the bag into her car to take back with her.<br /><br />This folded bag is so deceiving -- it truly folds up into a pouch about 11 inches square, and just under 3 inches thick... but it unfolds into a bag that is about 27 inches long, 12 inches wide and about 15 inches deep. Excellent size for a sports or gym bag, or even for carrying two weeks worth of laundry!<br /><br />Both the handles and the shoulder strap are easy and comfortable to use, and the zipper is decent quality.<br /><br />The Amazon listing states that this duffel bag is covered by the following warranty "If you are not 100% satisfied with the duffel - Simply Return It For A Full Refund !... which seems to be an outstanding commitment to customer satisfaction. If an issue ever occurs I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this duffel bag gratis from the seller and our daughter put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.<br /><br />We found this duffel bag to be better than expected, nicely stylish, affordable and quite roomy. If you are looking for a lightweight bag for your on the go needs, for use as I have described above, then our daughter would recommend giving this bag from BAGO a try based on her experience with it.<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.[EOS]

I am on the constant lookout for products that will help that. I was offered this as a promotion and jumped at the chance. My honest opinion is that it is great. First off it is a huge container of powder. I started adding it to my chocolate milk. I throw it in my shaker bottle so that I make sure that it dissolves fully. When adding it with milk I can't really taste the citrus flavor. After just a few days My nails are slightly stronger. I also have joint pains and it has helped those go away some.[EOS]
[BOS]Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China![SEP]They are a real eye-opener![SEP]Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China! I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.<br />I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a "Product of China”. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.<br /><br />It is useful to read "SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA” and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online. They are a real eye-opener![EOS]

[BOS]I don't think i have ever read a worse book.[SEP]How it got reprinted as a paperback is beyond me.[SEP]I don't think i have ever read a worse book.  It said it was a novel - but there were 1-1/2 pages on "nuclear chemistry" - my interest, and 243 pages of probably cathartic release about the authors family life. My first hint was when the library said this is a 32 Day book loan period, meaning essentially that there was very low activity on the book.  The writer is of very average skill, the descriptions of both life in Oak Ridge and Los Alamos were the high points of interest.  Apparently the author needs to tell the world of his teenage sexual development, otherwise there seems to be no point to the book.  How it got reprinted as a paperback is beyond me.[EOS]

[BOS][[VIDEOID:mo1LKDPXHDOWZ1R]]These are quality mics that were affordable and sound excellent.[SEP]I posted a video that hopefully shows the system well and shows you all that it comes with and how it works.[SEP][[VIDEOID:mo1LKDPXHDOWZ1R]]These are quality mics that were affordable and sound excellent. It's an easy system to set up and operate, everything was included to get started. Nothing feels cheap or junky about any of the parts. It really doesn't have the clarity and power that you might get out of a single microphone plugged into an amp because it's simply multiple mics running off it's own antenna receiver. However, it works perfectly for getting voices heard over a conference, church- something like that, it's perfect. And, it allows multiple people to have a mic and not have to pass one around.. that is always awkward and wastes time. It's a fantastic system!

Having been exposed to Pilates years ago and enjoying it, I wanted to investigate it more thoroughly. This is one of several DVD's I ordered and it is definitely worth the money.  The DVD for inflexible people is perfect for my husband who has arthritis issues, and I'm having great fun practicing the other two DVD's.  There are several selections on each disk and one can choose a workout based on time or body part. Challenging for me as a beginner/intermediate and offers a great variety of exercise sessions.[EOS]

[BOS]Although I gave this a 1 star, it was not due to the equipment itself, but the seller.[SEP]BEWARE![SEP]Although I gave this a 1 star, it was not due to the equipment itself, but the seller. The product would not work with any memory card that I tried, but the owner claims that it did work with memory cards. This is an old model of Kodak and due to the fact that Kodak has stop making digital cameras, some compatible options are very limited or can not be found. Sometimes some of the new options will not work with old items and that should be stated in the presentation of the product. Product was returned and seller refused to give full refund. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER, IS NOT A COMPANY, BUT AN INDIVIDUAL TRYING TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK ON OLD UNWANTED MERCHANDISE. BEWARE!!!!!!!![EOS]

[BOS]First of all, the title &#34;summer&#34; through me off, because I was under impression that it is meant only for summer use.[SEP]Sorry![SEP]First of all, the title &#34;summer&#34; through me off, because I was under impression that it is meant only for summer use. Come to find out, it is the name of the company. LOL<br /><br />Regardless, the concept of these is interesting - I could see how it could work, but this lazy approach to swaddling didn't work for us. Our newborn was not even 38 weeks, but by the end of the first week of being born he already weigh 7 lbs. Nevertheless, his bony little butt ended up finding his way out of these regardless how tightly you secure him with the Velcro closure. The most discomforting sight however, is the space between where legs go in (pocket) and where the bottom of the wrapping starts. Our son would have both of his arms and hands sticking through that opening, so when he lifts his arms, the entire top portion is bunched up between his arms and head- so his neck. Maybe it wouldn't cause reason for concern; it looked a bit scary. Finding him fussing and getting antsy every time we saw that certainly did not help either. Good old fashion swaddling is still the best way to go! Sorry![EOS]

Without it I couldn't get the factory rusted and tightened nuts and bolts loose without stripping them with the hand wrenches. It worked like it was advertised. I'm glad I went with the larger tank (6.5 gal) and lower powered motor instead of the higher power (14 Amps model) with a tiny tank (1.6gal) I would recommend this air compressor for anyone who needs a compressor to blow out computers, fill tires, run basic hand tools.

Now i connect without stress to my TV from the converter.<br /><br />Lastly, to avoid any damage its best you ensure both input and output devices are off when plugging or unplugging HDMI cables.<br /><br />Thanks[EOS]

[BOS]This is the 3rd Leatherman I've bought.[SEP]Interesting.[SEP]This is the 3rd Leatherman I've bought.  The first was a 1st Gen Wave that I broke the pliers, the second was a 2nd Gen Wave that was stolen while in the field, and now the Surge.  To me the 1st Gen Wave is where its at.  The small flathead was the PERFECT size and new one breaks very easily.  The new scissors also does not cut as well and sometimes jams up on the pliers when closing.  Leatherman needs to bring back the 1st Gen Wave.<br /><br />Anyhow, the Surge is beefier in the hand but still fits in a 9mm mag pouch (how I carry it on my MOLLE chest rig).  The only noticable difference other than the size is that the outer file has been replaced with a beefier scissors that actually cuts instead of bending material.  The inner flathead is wider, the soon-to-be-broken small flathead is still there, and there is a small scraping blade (at least that's what I think it might be).<br /><br />One of the things I miss most about my 1st Gen Wave is that with minimal break-in I could open it like a butterfly knife with one hand.  Have some gun oil ready upon opening.  All said, I would highly recommend this tool over the 2nd Gen Wave (but not the 1st Gen Wave).<br /><br />UPDATE:  Upon removing the sheath from the packaging I noticed a small, thin plastic sheath containing a file blade that can be swapped out with the saw blade.  Interesting.[EOS]

[BOS]Pros: Concept of a case with an attachable strap to work as an armband.[SEP]This material in itself is too painful to wear.[SEP]Pros: Concept of a case with an attachable strap to work as an armband. That's really about it.<br />Cons: Silicone material does not work well for work outs or running, except maybe very light workouts. It sticks to the arm with no flexibility to allow free movement of the arm. I usually run 3-4 miles followed by 25 minutes of strength training. This armband was painful to wear for more than a mile. When I removed it after the run, the skin is flaming red in that spot.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I think a more flexible material that doesn't cause so much friction would be better suited for this design. This material in itself is too painful to wear.[EOS]

[BOS]My 5-year old niece LOVED creating her own markers![SEP]The wait time for ink to soak into the marker is only a couple minutes.[SEP]My 5-year old niece LOVED creating her own markers! Kids 8 and up may not need an adult to help, but under that and an adult may need to help squeeze the ink for the child. Otherwise, children can do most everything else themselves. It's easy to use, and surprisingly not too messy at all. The ink is not washable, so you'll want to put newspaper down just in case the ink drips. Kids can learn about colors in a fresh and unique way. They can mix their own colors with a helpful chart or try their own. Plus, they can create labels on each marker to name their colors whatever they wish. And when supplies are low, you can purchase additional ink or markers separately as needed. The wait time for ink to soak into the marker is only a couple minutes.[EOS]

[BOS]Initially we bought the 19" Conoco [[ASIN:B00768SS8K CONOCO Piano Lamp Portable 19" LED Piano Lamp, Black w/Brass Accent]].[SEP]We still love it and use it every day.[SEP]Initially we bought the 19" Conoco [[ASIN:B00768SS8K CONOCO Piano Lamp Portable 19" LED Piano Lamp, Black w/Brass Accent]].  That lamp, because of its design, (and the design of our Yamaha C3 music bench) would not illuminate the entire sheet of music from top to bottom unless the shade was adjusted (rotated) out...and then the LEDs shined directly into our eyes.  Instead of simply returning the lamp, we called Conoco customer service and found out what a great company this is.  After explaining the issue to the tech, he immediately suggested two other solutions for us: a 14" lamp with a gooseneck arm between the lamp and clamp, and this 22" lamp, where the radius of the attachment arms is about twice that of the 19" lamp.  We chose this one and can only say "wow!"<br /><br />Not only is the lamp more suitable because of the attachment arm radius, it also has a height adjustment which we've set to accommodate some of the larger page-size, antique sheet music pieces we use.  The light quality and quantity is superb and because of the design of this model, it also illuminates the keyboard, without any light overflow into our eyes.  We absolutely, without reservation, recommend this lamp!<br /><br />One final word about Conoco: not only was the customer service tech helpful in understanding and suggesting solutions to our issue with the first lamp, he went out of his way to make sure we were satisfied.  After making the decision to try this lamp, the first question he asked was "how can WE do this?" I suggested going back through Amazon.  His comment was that if we needed any additional help, to just call him.  Overall, a very satisfying customer experience.<br /><br />***Update 12/2013***<br />We just bought a second one of these for our son's family.  Each time they visit, they admire this lamp, so we bought one for them as a gift.  We still love it and use it every day.[EOS]

[BOS]I've heard great things about these wrenches for a while and couldn't wait to get a set of my own.[SEP]The bad doesn't come out until you go to use it, and then it's just disappointing.[SEP]I've heard great things about these wrenches for a while and couldn't wait to get a set of my own. Unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed.  First, the blow mold case is exactly like the pic (which I guess makes sense) - there's no top, just what you see, which doesn't really make any sense, but whatever - I wouldn't take a star off for that.  I'm dropping stars because the sizing isn't right.  I've used the 10, 14, 17, and 18 so far.  The 18 is way off on the bolts I used it on (front suspension on my car).  The 5 deg. ratcheting does you no good if you've got 15 deg. of slop in the fit.  For the record, the bolt was an 18, and my other wrenches and sockets fit it perfectly.  The 10 was off as well, but not nearly as bad as the 18, and the others were close but still worse than most of my other tools.<br /><br />The other reason I drop a star is because they're flimsy and skinny.  With an XL set like this you expect more heft.  When I'm really pulling on the wrench it feels like it's going to flip over or crumple or something.  There's plenty of strength in the direction you need, but the thinness in the other direction doesn't inspire me to really pull on them, which is the point of an XL wrench.<br /><br />The good: They appear well made, nice finish, well marked, the ratcheting mechanism is crisp and solid.  The bad doesn't come out until you go to use it, and then it's just disappointing.[EOS]

[BOS]I recently purchased this game through amazon, I didn't buy it at first because I didn't think it was worth anywhere near 70$ so.[SEP]I've noticed that I enjoy playing ts4 more so than I ever did with ts3)[SEP]I recently purchased this game through amazon, I didn't buy it at first because I didn't think it was worth anywhere near 70$ so... I waited for a price drop. I can honestly say after having played on and off for a little over a week, even with the price drop this game is certainly not worth anywhere past 40$. I could write a whole page review concerning this game but many of the things that I would say have been said by other reviewers. Also even with all the reviews I'd gone through and looking at the let's play videos, I still purchased this game; I have been a simmer since TS1 so with the price drop I decided to give this game a try. Not everything in TS4 is awful; their new build mode and the rich vibrant (even though the environmental background might be simulated) neighborhood is welcoming and fresh. I'm not too keen on the loading screens in fact I'm curious to see how that will pan out once expansion packs start its' release. The toddler stage has been completely omitted so the infant "popping" out to a full grown child is honestly ridiculous and hilarious. I also don't dislike or like the pre-color coded options. It works and it doesn't work, meaning some of the design/color options are just terrible and unable to match. I also began to see a growing number of bugs here and there I'm not certain if it was because I kept the game turned on for awhile or because the Sims game as we all know it has an increasing amount of bugs in the first place. I understand that alot of the things that were omitted were to have the game run smoother and it does but it has a design flaw. The game grows on you and it's fun however how long will that last for its' asking price or until the first expansion pack is released? All in all for those of you out there who are on the fence about buying this game like many others have said, buy it for the right price. This base pack certainly lacks content for its' asking price but that is also nothing new with the Sims game franchise,unfortunately. (i.e ts3 eps)    (edited: the gameplay itself is fun and it delivers in that aspect. I've noticed that I enjoy playing ts4 more so than I ever did with ts3)[EOS]
[BOS]I like these sheets SO FAR.[SEP]Stay Tuned I guess for further information on these sheets.[SEP]I like these sheets SO FAR.  They are very soft, and seemed to have laundryed well.  Now we will see if they will hold up to wear. Of course I didn't pay much for them so it will not be a huge loss if they do not.  I love the way they feel though, it is like pure down or silk feeling, very comfortable to sleep in.  Somebody said &#34;they were hot&#34;.  They are a little warmer than my cotton percale sheets, but not uncomfortable in Air Conditioned room.  This also applies for the gray Clar Clark Premier Queen Size sheets that I bought.  They also laundered well, and look very nice.  We will see how well they hold up over time. So far I am very impressed for the money I spent.  They were packaged very nicely, just like you would find in an upscale department store.

[BOS]Very good mattress.[SEP]minus 1 star for that.[SEP]Very good mattress.  Not too firm, not too soft.  I think the top 2 layers of the gel foam and comfort foam make the difference.  So far so good, we've only had it a few days and it's the 2nd bed in my daughter's room.  My wife has used it a couple of nights and she is happy with it.<br /><br />The one thing I was not impressed with is the stitching on the bamboo cover is a joke..  it started to come undone in quite a few spots just as we got it open and it was decompressing.  Pretty minor I guess,  but they could do a lot better in that regard...  minus 1 star for that.[EOS]

So I'm giving this 4 stars and will update to 5 if my results continue even without nutrition (I don't like changing what I eat). In any case, so far I've lost a good amount of weight and my stomach definitely looks better.<br /><br />P.S. For the one reviewer who didn't like some of the other reviews here.

[BOS]I have been using these for more than a year now.[SEP]I'll probably do some shopping though when I need to replace them.[SEP]I have been using these for more than a year now. I certainly have not had any of them snap, but the most use they see is on the end of an electric impact (~1300 in-lbs). My biggest gripe with them (and the reason for 4 stars) is the finish. They seem to rust even in mild humidity. I got rained on during a job once and even though I dried them off (on my pant leg), they still rusted like any other tool that had been submerged for two days... I'm fairly certain that these are just bare, possibly heat treated, steel.<br />My lesser gripe is their length. They add about 1&#34; of unnecessary tool. Some might like that, but if I want an extension, I can add an extension, I can't add a reduction :P<br />Still, for $5.25 delivered, I'm happy with these ones. I'll probably do some shopping though when I need to replace them.[EOS]

[BOS]This is my 2nd TAG.[SEP]Consider yourself warned.[SEP]This is my 2nd TAG. Nice looking watch with sapphire crystal and 200M water resistance, but not terribly accurate. Has a so-so ETA movement. Bought it in 2008 and had to have battery replaced in 2011. Now have to have battery replaced again (March, 2015), and decided to have TAG do it. So I sent to TAG for estimate, which cost me $35 insured through UPS. At first cheapest service they would offer that includes battery replacement was $95. Ouch! Then was told watch needed complete overhaul at $170. So that's $205 to replace the battery!!!!!!! Probably hadn't worn it 100 times since I've owned it (special occasions only), and it is in pristine condition. You can get the battery replaced anywhere, but if you want gaskets replaced, reputable jewelers will send it to TAG and probably charge you a premium for their time. IMHO, this is a BIG rip off by TAG's aftermarket service group in NJ. Definitely not going to buy another TAG for sure. Next watch will probably be Seiko dive watch of the &#34;Tuna&#34; variety which has much better movement, is water resistant to 300M, and is almost $200 cheaper. Consider yourself warned.[EOS]

[BOS]I was so excited to find this projector.[SEP]It is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier with this product![SEP]I was so excited to find this projector. I've been wanting to do outdoor movies with my neighbors and this is perfect! It's so easy to setup, I can easily have an outdoor movie setup and ready to go in less than 1/2 an hour. Here's my take on this projector:    INSTALLATION  Installation is super easy. Just plug in the power cord and your video device cable. There are three different ways to connect this projector to your video device (HDMI, RCA, component).  The easiest and best is HDMI. There are no cables included, so I had to go out and buy and HDMI 25 foot cable and got what I wanted. This allows me to run it from either my cable box or computer super easy and the projector can be further away than just the standard short length HDMI included with my TV. With the HDMI it's a simple plug that includes both video and audio. You could run 2 HDMI cables since there's two ports in the back of the projector. I was able to hook this up with my Comcast Xfinity cable box super quick and had TV projected in my living room super-quick. Installation couldn't be easier!    DISPLAY QUALITY  Display quality is amazing!!! It is crisp, bright, and clear. It even displays beautifully in the daylight. I was totally amazed at how great the picture quality is. The color and clarity looks just like a regular flat-screen TV.    SOUND  There are built-in speakers and they're perfect for my needs. If you want to add external speakers you can, but totally not necessary for my outdoor use with small groups of people. The sound is very crisp and clear.    3D GLASSES  This couldn't be easier. I was able to try 3D using my Comcast Xfinity tripleplay 3D channel. It is included with my standard service, I just had to contact Comcast for them to "enter the code" so I could access channel 897. I charged the glasses before use for a couple hours and watched 3D for a little over an hour with no reduction in the battery power. All you do is turn on the power on the glasses, then hit the pairing button on the glasses and it paired right away with the projector with no problems. The 3D quality was great! Comcast has on demand 3D movies, so I can't wait to take advantage of that service since I don't have a 3D blueray player (although I'm considering getting one now). You must have a 3D player if you want to watch your own 3D movies.    PROJECTOR SCREENS  I wanted a portable screen and I finally found one at Fry's in Wilsonville, Oregon manufactured by Loch. [[ASIN:B00DV1INFY LOCH 84" diagonal 4:3 Tripod Projection Screen]] I tried Best Buy and was disappointed that they didn't have any screens "in store", the guy just wanted to sell me one from their on-line store. I didn't want to buy it on-line because the shipping is so expensive and I wanted to see the quality of the screen before I made the purchase. Fry's has the Loch screen in 100" and 83". I went with the 83" model and it is perfect for indoor and outdoor use. 100" [[ASIN:B00HK23QJI Matte White 100" diagonal Portable Projector Screen]] was too big for my little, tiny living room. I also considered the Epson portable screen [[ASIN:B000HRYV38 Epson Duet 80-Inch Dual Aspect Ratio Projection Screen]]. You can also project on the wall...I did in my computer room and it was so cool....read on...    COMPUTER HOOKUP  Just like the cable box, it was super easy to connect to my HP Envy laptop through the HDMI cable. The only problem I had was I had previously put it in 3D mode and didn't realize I had to take it out of 3D even after unplugging the projector. I can surf the web, watch YouTube videos, and show my huge library of photos on my wall. Even work on Word and Excel documents in super-large format...this is like having a HUGE COMPUTER MONITOR.    TECHNICAL SUPPORT  I had to call Epson tech support when I couldn't get my laptop display to show up. It's funny, their tech support looks like you're calling Long Beach California, but the tech support is actually routed through the Philippines. The technician spoke very good english, was courteous, and helpful.    SIZE AND CONSTRUCTION  It is fairly large (measuring approximately 15 x 12 x 6 inches) but worth the extra size over the tiny portable units since the quality is extraordinary! It has a big remote (measuring approximately 2.25 x 8.5 x 1 inch) with lots of buttons. What I really like is the remote has a "light" button that illuminates the buttons, so it's super easy to see and use.    OVERALL  Overall, I love this projector. It is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier with this product![EOS]

I am soooo glad that I did. I love everything about it. I found it super easy to apply with the doe tip applicator. I thought it would smear and be messy but it really didn't. I got it on perfectly even in one try. The color is also gorgeous. It looks a little brighter and more pink on my lips than I though it would be but still nice. It is like a bright magenta. The formula is so much more creamy than I thought it would be too.  It does not feel drying, or sticky on my lips at all. The only downside is that it will wipe./kiss off your lips. I thought it would dry to a more colorsafe finish like a stain. Really that's not a big deal to me just thought it was worth mentioning. Overall, I love this product and I will definitely be buying tons more colors.[EOS]

[BOS]** Update October 2014 **    Well after about 14 months of use this phone crapped out.[SEP]I doubt there currently an ST phone that delivers more bang for the buck[SEP]** Update October 2014 **    Well after about 14 months of use this phone crapped out. It was not dropped, submerged, or otherwise abused. One evening it just decided to quit. The screen started to flicker and stay on, all buttons became unresponsive, it's dead. Pulled and re installed the battery, same thing. Completely unusable.     As time went on I became less and less satisfied with this phone. It developed tremendous lag with many functions. Sometimes I would tap a name in my contact list and it would take 15 seconds or more to bring up the call screen and complete the call. Beyond that, aps would constantly bomb out. It became a very frustrating phone to use. Honestly, I wasn't all that upset when it died, at least I could look forward to something else. I can no longer recommend this phone based on the entire 14 months of use and it's death.     I found a killer deal on a refurbished LG Optimus Showtime and have been using it for a week. So far I love it. It looks and works like new. Time will tell if it ends up being a clunker like the Ascend.       I did some research on the brand, and discovered Huawei is a Chinese brand, and they are the world's 6th biggest manufacturer of cell phones. They have more market share than HTC, Sony, TCL, Blackberry, and Motorola, only slightly less than LG and ZTE, and 1/3 that of Apple. By the way, It's pronounced "WAH-way" and the 881C is a very nice phone. Don't be scared off by a brand you've never heard of. I am thinking most people will hear of them soon in the USA.    This is my 4th ST phone and my second android. My previous android was a low end LG. The experience with this phone is 3X better than the previous. So far it runs every ap smoothly, Runs Youtube videos without a glitch when signal is 2 bars or more (though there may be some buffering at the beginning). This phone runs on Verizon which is much better and faster in the area where I live, rural Michigan. I should have been on Verizon long ago.    The look and feel of this phone are quality. The 4" display is beautiful and it's a good blend; big enough screen yet still small enough to fit in a pocket. It feels thin and sleek and not bulky. While I would not claim this to rival an I-phone it does have that look and feel and a similar experience. Compared to an iphone it's 500% cheaper and almost as good in my opinion. No brainer. For the $$ you will be hard pressed to find a better bang.    Do yourself a favor and buy a micro SD card immediately (well under $10). Then go into "Settings, Storage, Default storage location" and set the SD card as the default storage location for installed aps. This will prevent you from running out of memory quickly by installing too many aps, as there is not much extra internal memory.    The only area I would appreciate a little more performance is with the battery life. The phone has a 1750 mAh battery, which is big. However, battery performance is just average. Not a deal breaker, if you want a fancy phone with the bells and whistles this is the price you pay. Having a charger in the office or car to top it off is nice to have with this phone.    We shall see how this phone does over time. My LG developed lots of bugs and glitches after a while. So far this phone has exceeded expectations. If you want a great Android on ST through Verizon this phone will not dissapoint. I doubt there currently an ST phone that delivers more bang for the buck[EOS]

[BOS]My vet recommended this to me.[SEP]There has to be a way to make these so that dogs will actually want to eat them.[SEP]My vet recommended this to me.  It may well work.  But the chewables are not something my dog wants to eat.  I tried grinding and mixing it with his food; his response was to stop eating his food.  The tablets are so big that they are impossible to hide and with a large dog who need 2 1/2 tablets a day, it's like a full-time job trying to figure out how to get him to eat it.  Switched to the chewables after years of trying to get the excessively large pills into him.  There has to be a way to make these so that dogs will actually want to eat them.[EOS]

[BOS]So I am doing this review after using for a while and I have gotten some wonderful and surprising results on my face.[SEP]I would definitely recommend this to others.[SEP]So I am doing this review after using for a while and I have gotten some wonderful and surprising results on my face. I have a more youthful appearance and more elasticity. My face is a lot brighter, the redness and blotchy discolored areas are lightening up as well as under my eyes and neck. It just seemed to pull my complexion together into one.<br />I did have a deep line on my forehead that has been there for years, I never thought anything would help because it was extremely deep. Also, some lines around my mouth where they show when I smile. The line on my forehead is gradually decreasing in depth and less noticeable and the wrinkles around my mouth are getting firmer with each use.<br />Getting the right amount of the serum out is easy. The bottle has a dropper that I can get a few drops out at a time which is plenty enough for my entire face. Really generous size as well. I would definitely recommend this to others.[EOS]
[BOS]Fits on a 27.5 mountain bike which has a thick handlebar where other bells were not big enough, and very useful on busy trails, people respond very well to a bell as opposed to either calling out or not signaling them at all.[SEP]I used a nail clipper to file this sharp edge down.[SEP]Fits on a 27.5 mountain bike which has a thick handlebar where other bells were not big enough, and very useful on busy trails, people respond very well to a bell as opposed to either calling out or not signaling them at all. You can turn the clapper 360 easily, so you can have it where it works best. However, as others have mentioned, the band is similar to a zip-tie in concept, it is only going to go on once and stay there, it is not designed to be removed without also destroying the band. Make extra sure you have it where you want it before you tighten down the band. Also, once you do have it where you want it and the band is tightened down, if you cut off the excess band, it can leave a sharp edge on the band that remains. I used a nail clipper to file this sharp edge down.[EOS]
[BOS]This is one (or 3) of the few movies that I'd say is very long but will never get tired of watching even for the &#34;nth&#34; time.[SEP]If you've seen the trilogy and actually liked it, I'm sure you'll also love Scarface, American Gangster, Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects.[SEP]This is one (or 3) of the few movies that I'd say is very long but will never get tired of watching even for the &#34;nth&#34; time. It's a multi-generational crime saga everybody should see. One of the best American films that has ever been created, I will definitely judge anyone who hasn't seen the trilogy yet. It's really amazing. Describing it as amazing would be an understatement. As for the restoration, it's a job well done but I still want to watch it in its original grainy copy. It just feels so real and nostalgic and mafia-ish and all. If you've seen the trilogy and actually liked it, I'm sure you'll also love Scarface, American Gangster, Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects.[EOS]
[BOS]Excellent eye piece for my Nikon D700.[SEP]Well worth its price![SEP]Excellent eye piece for my Nikon D700. I wear eye glasses and have not found this to be a problem. I'm also still able to see the shooting information in the view finder. This is worth the expense. I have not tried it with my macro lens yet but with the 24-70mm and the 70-200mm is a wonderful addition to my gear. As most of the reviewers pointed out it helps with framing the subject.<br /><br />The eye piece comes out of the frame of the camera a bit more 1/8&#34; than the stock eyepiece. I found this extremely comfortable and more fitting to my overall comfort holding the camera during focusing and framing. Well worth its price![EOS]

I am 5'8&#34; and my husband is 6'3&#34; so this is sweet!  For $132.77 this rocks.  I'd even have paid the full price of $159.95.  I am NOT a fan of top loading backpacks but this has nice side access zippers to get at the stuff that is packed down at at the bottom, so best of both worlds.  The adjustability of the back support is nice and easily used.  Being able to continually adjust the back/torso fit straps really does lead to all day trail comfort, they really nailed it.  Even nicer is the adjustability of the front chest straps, something I wish my old Kelty had.  The pockets on the waist belt are really handy, we liked those a lot.  We are not likely to use the hydration system capability though but it is nice to have that as an option, my husband in his younger years did used to se a camelback, so he is happy to have the ability.  All the cinch straps and adjustments and pockets and all, it just seems really well thought out and designed, we are impressed.[EOS]

[BOS]The moment that you can take your baby out to eat, put them in a high chair and order food off a regular menu is a huge milestone![SEP]They are a little pricey, but totally worth it for the piece of mind while dining out.[SEP]The moment that you can take your baby out to eat, put them in a high chair and order food off a regular menu is a huge milestone! This product makes that transition a bit easier. I was a little neurotic when we went out to eat. As soon as we got to our table, I was getting my son settled and neurotically wiping down every surface with Clorox wipes. It was a bit of a production. Now instead, I just rip off the sticky strips (which is trick at first, but it gets easier) and place this on the table. I usually put about 4/5 of the table topper on the top of the table and then leave enough to cover the edge of the able. (I attach the bottom of the placement to the bottom of the table). This way it covers anywhere my son might touch..including the side and bottom which probably don't get cleaned that often!<br /><br />These table toppers are great because I can just attach them to the table and I don't feel like my son is eating off of what could be a dirty table. It's also great because I can just scoop these up and wrap up his mess, so I don't feel like I'm leaving a mess on the table for the server to clean up.<br /><br />The travel case is key. It is thin enough to keep in the front pocket of my diaper bag and is very convenient.  I get these for all of my new mom friends as one of the 'essential' items.<br /><br />They are a little pricey, but totally worth it for the piece of mind while dining out.[EOS]

[BOS]This isn't Apple certified.[SEP]It's a shame because I really wanted an extra long cable.[SEP]This isn't Apple certified. After about two days, I began to receive a message on my phone stating that it was not compatible. Although it the cord states a 2 yr warranty, I noticed that there is a very short return window on Amazon. The warranty is a nice courtesy; however, I feel that having to go through all that customer service trouble to only risk having the product work for another few weeks was not worth the trouble. It's a shame because I really wanted an extra long cable.[EOS]

The Lelo annoyed the heck out of me because it was so easy to change the settings - which were rhythm and intensity - without wanting to.  Imagine being right on the brink and BAM! off it goes.  The Lelo ones are expensive too.  But, I trashed it because it annoyed me and got this little beauty.  All that changes is the intensity - which is all I ever want anyway.  To turn the unit on OR change intensity, it's just a twist on the cap end.

[BOS]I bought this container for birdseed.[SEP]Back to the drawing board.[SEP]I bought this container for birdseed.  I wanted to store by bird seed on my patio, near my feeders, so that when I was outside, I could just fill them.  When I kept this container by the front door on the inside of my house, there was no problem.  When I moved it outside so I would have more access, the squirrels broke into the top flap and broke it to provide 24-7 access within a week.  Now, I have some mafia-level squirrels (they once ate all the peanut brittle out of a package that was delivered without affecting the other items in the package) in both muscle and scheming, but they were not phased at all by the flap on the container.  Back to the drawing board.[EOS]

My son doesn't seem to mind, for the most part, but sometimes it is annoying.<br /><br />Sometimes frustrating to follow the moves.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this game.

[BOS]I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of using TC's generally speaking but my opinion has been based on shooting film from decades ago.[SEP]For the serious hobbyist or pro shooter, however, I'd have to say the Kenko 1.4x Pro 300 DGX is probably a non-starter.[SEP]I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of using TC's generally speaking but my opinion has been based on shooting film from decades ago. I wondered if maybe technology had caught up and if today's tele-converters were better than the ones I remembered. I ordered the Kenko after reading several reviews figuring for the price, I can't get hurt too badly. My experience with the Kenko 1.4x did not impress me. Build quality seemed good. Not great, but good. The TC fit well on my D750 with no discernible &#34;play&#34;. With a lens attached there was a tiny wiggle. The TC works best with Nikon lenses; but this should not be surprising. What was a little surprising was just how bad the image quality was when used in conjunction with a non-Nikon lens. Using the Kenko with my Sigma 50mm f/1.4 Art series lens, for example, was a complete disaster. Used with a Nikon 85mm f/1.8G image sharpness was clearly degraded but still very acceptable. Chromatic aberration was apparent however and that kind of bugged me. Yes, I can remove with Photoshop but I prefer not having it to begin with. Auto-focus generally seemed to &#34;flutter&#34; and struggle a bit, even in full sunlight, but focus-lock did happen. In summary, I'd say this is a pretty mediocre piece of kit. I won't be keeping mine but I'm really picky about my image quality. For more casual shooters, this is probably a nice addition to the bag. For the serious hobbyist or pro shooter, however, I'd have to say the Kenko 1.4x Pro 300 DGX is probably a non-starter.[EOS]

[BOS]I've been using Sweetleaf Sweetener for more years than I care to mention.[SEP]Mostly it's just a matter of trial and error to find what works for each individual, but I would vouch for Sweetleaf Sweetener, and I try never to run out of it.[SEP]I've been using Sweetleaf Sweetener for more years than I care to mention. They've perfected Stevia a great deal since the early days when I would dip a toothpick into the bottle and still use too much. It's still easy to use too much, and I've gotten pretty good at judging when a whole packet is called for or whether to sprinkle out less into my drink or whatever.<br /><br />I grow Stevia, just because I grow herbs, and it's a nice plant to have, but I've not been successful at drying the leaves for my own use. Even when I grind them in the coffee grinder, the powder just floats on top of my drink.<br /><br />There are controversies over the use of Stevia, just as there are over everything from eggs to green tea. I just know I can't use the artificial sweeteners like aspartame as they immediately give me migraines, as does anything sweetened with corn syrup. I sweeten with Agave Nectar, Stevia, local honey, and occasionally organic raw cane sugar. These work for me. Mostly it's just a matter of trial and error to find what works for each individual, but I would vouch for Sweetleaf Sweetener, and I try never to run out of it.[EOS]

I initially ordered another, less expensive brand and ended up cancelling my order after discovering it hadn't been shipped 5 days after I had placed my order. The one reason why I chose Müeller over other brands is that I hear/read so much about how wonderful the costumer service is. I began to read reviews as saw that the owners or at least a representative for Müeller had answered a large majority of the reviews or complaints. That is super impressive to me. SO- I cancelled my other order and ordered one from here. It shipped and I got it 3 days earlier than I expected. So far- I am a happy and excited gal![EOS]

[BOS]I am happy with this card.[SEP]I recommend it over this card because of the price difference unless you need the extra speed this card offers.[SEP]I am happy with this card.  It works well in my Sony NEX 5t camera.  I use an adapter so this card can work in both my camera and USB 3.0 adapter.  I am able to use the burst shot mode with my camera without an issue.  Slower cards don't let me take as many pictures in quick sequence.  I also have a Samsung EVO class card.  Its speed ratings are slower than this card, but for my purposes I can't tell the difference in speed (both cards are fast enough for my camera).  The Samsung is slightly cheaper and comes with an adapter.  I recommend it over this card because of the price difference unless you need the extra speed this card offers.[EOS]

[BOS]I have had many bluetooth speakers.[SEP]I would definitely buy this again.[SEP]I have had many bluetooth speakers. My husband goes through several a year because he uses them so frequently. So, when we were offered the opportunity to try this Bluetooth Speaker with LCD Display I was excited - but I was not sure that it would be any different from the others we have used.<br /><br />I took the speaker out of the box immediately after receiving it - and I have to say that I was very impressed with its overall look. It's very modern, sleek and sophisticated looking. Plus, the weird waterproof velvety texture is fun and feels nice. I love the bright blue LCD screen - it makes it super easy to see what channel you are on - or which controls you are using.<br /><br />I also loved that unlike so many other devices of this variety - this bluetooth speaker has it's own charger - it does NOT run off of batteries! It has a USB style charger that plugs into the wall or your computer. It charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time. No more having to buy batteries every week. You will get back the cost of this speaker just in the lack of having to buy batteries.<br /><br />The speaker is really simple to use - my phone found it easily - and, after the first time - they are now friends! My phone and the speaker find each other instantly - no lag time. The sound quality is amazing. This is probably one of the larger waterproof shower style speakers that I have owned - and it definitely has a lot of oomph to it. The speaker itself has its own volume and also responds to the media level on your phone. That can take a little getting used to - but it's pretty simple. Overall, I am in love with this speaker. We use it every day - it suctions to a wide variety of surfaces 0 si we can use it all around the house. I really wish it came in more bright, fun colors - but other than that I am super satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely buy this again.[EOS]

Battery could last a little longer but it comes with 2 and the charger charges 2 at once. There are also upgraded batteries and more batteries. Enough ranting....this heli is great![EOS]

[BOS]I am a massage therapist and I use almond oil at my job on a daily basis.[SEP]The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use![SEP]I am a massage therapist and I use almond oil at my job on a daily basis. The oil really helps soothe the skin, especially when you're working with clients who are exposed to the elements a lot. I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- [[ASIN:B00AJFV8L6 NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz]]. It really helps soften the skin in those extra hard places.<br /><br />I use the stuff at home too. One dab of each oil in the morning give my hands a soft feeling throughout the day whether I'm working or not. It's great on faces and for some clients, they've told me they use it in their hair as well. The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use![EOS]

I had to trim several inches from it and singe the edges with a lighter but it works great.  The first day, I only put the harness part on her.  I took her around my neighborhood on the leash and then into the woods behind my house off the leash.  She normally runs at full speed chasing deer and whatnot but that day she stayed right beside me--even without any weight on it.  I've since moved up to two 15 oz. cans of peas and our short morning walks around the neighborhood seem to wear her out much more than without the pack.  The leash actually has slack now.<br /><br />So....yes.  I recommend this thing.[EOS]

[BOS]The G1077M is part of the Gitzo Classic Center Ball Head series, marketed as a petite head for travelers and matched to their carbon fiber Mountaineer tripods.[SEP]Nevertheless, this rig is light, fits in my jean pocket and provides amazingly solid support for my Olympus E-P3 camera.[SEP]The G1077M is part of the Gitzo Classic Center Ball Head series, marketed as a petite head for travelers and matched to their carbon fiber Mountaineer tripods. I bought it in 2004 to use on a Gitzo G1028 Mountaineer. My gripped EOS 10D and 17-40 4L USM zoom were too close to the 4.4 LB load limit and I was fighting drifting in portrait orientation. So rather than struggle with every angle, I bought the next size up, the Gitzo G1177M, rated to 8.8 LB. All it needed was a modest amount of torque and the angle was locked. The G1177M became my favorite head and traveled with me for a decade.<br /><br />The wee G1077M languished for years in a desk drawer, unused and forgotten. I started shooting with an Olympus E-P3 micro 4/3 system and needed a small tripod to complement it. So I installed the G1077M on my Manfrotto 209B table top tripod and the combo was magic: balanced, light and smooth as silk. And no drift whatsoever. The E-P3 felt like it belonged on that head. Although the E-P3 is metal and armed with an EVF and fast prime, it's still a lightweight compared to even a petite DSLR.<br /><br />So while the G1077M is not well suited for heavy DSLRs, it is ideal for compact cameras like M4/3 or point 'n shoot, and at its best mounted on a table top tripod like a Manfrotto 209B or Giottos QU500. In a pinch, a DSLR works fine on the G1077M as long as you stick to horizontal orientation.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION: Most metal parts are magnesium for strength and minimal weight. The ball housing sports an attractive sliver and black speckle enamel and, after years of use, has proved to be surprisingly chip and scratch resistant. The bottom is tapped for a standard 3/8 inch tripod mount thread. The top platform has a 1/4 inch bolt for mounting a camera.<br /><br />A single large knob is used for locking the ball. There is no separate tension knob. To mount a camera you loosen it and turn the top platform until the screw is snug. The platform is large and knurled for a sure grip even in wet weather.<br /><br />One odd thing I noticed while everything was apart was the ball is hollow and I could look down the stem and see out the bottom. Probably the hollow ball is a weight saving measure.<br /><br />KIRK QR Clamp Install: I have Arca-Swiss quick release plates on all my cameras so I decided to add a small Kirk QR clamp to the G1077M [[ASIN:B006U43AMA Kirk Enterprises 1'' Quick Release Clamp]]. First I screwed it into the 1/4 bolt on top of the disk. I soon realized the disk was redundant and removed it, mounting the Kirk clamp directly on the ball stem. The appearance is OEM and the operation is smooth, fast and natural. The installation of the Kirk clamp on the stem was harder than expected due to Locktite on the threads. I had to hold the stem still with a small pliers (with cloth to keep from scratching it) and unscrew the disk with rubber gloves for extra grip. The 1/4 inch stud had Locktite too and I had to use the pliers to remove it too. I cleaned off the Locktite and repositioned the stud so the top was flush with the top of the Kirk clamp (& deeper in the stem). And, yes, I applied a wee bit of Locktite 242 to keep the rig from turning under load. So 30 minutes of toil but what a great lightweight combo!<br /><br />LOAD CAPACITY: This is only a 120 g head and rated for light duty loads of 4.4 pounds, albeit the true capacity is much lower. I've owned heads from Manfrotto, Gitzo, Sunwayfoto and Really Right Stuff and they all greatly exaggerate load capacity. The Manfrotto and Gitzo heads tend to lock securely at about 50% of their rated load capacity. Indeed, I found about 2 LBs to be the true capacity while using the drop slot or at a steep angle. I recently tested a [[ASIN:B00AMNWXDW SUNWAYFOTO FB-28 Mini Tripod Ball Head Arca Compatible 7 oz Sunway FB28]], rated at 26 LB, and found the true capacity to be about 2 LB as well.<br /><br />LAST BLURB: The weight and space conscious traveler desiring a high quality head for point'n shoot and M4/3 cameras can't go wrong with the G1077M. And it is even better with the Kirk QRC-1 mounted topside, making for fast and secure connections. The Gitzo-Kirk pairing appears OEM and the combined operation is smooth, fast and natural.<br /><br />Finally, many will question why would anybody in their right mind spend upwards of $160 for a table top tripod. I certainly wouldn't if I didn't already own a G1077M. Nevertheless, this rig is light, fits in my jean pocket and provides amazingly solid support for my Olympus E-P3 camera.[EOS]

Also, I wish the description had mentioned that the poles are black; they look tacky with the beige stands I'd bought for the previous two (which had beige poles).<br />If you're looking for umbrellas that give true sun and heat protection, these aren't it. I do like the very bright, saturated yellow color. These won't fade as quickly as the previous two, most likely.[EOS]

[BOS]This is an expensive joke (as well as a huge waster of space).[SEP]My TV is a four or five year old Samsung, incidentally.[SEP]This is an expensive joke (as well as a huge waster of space).  I bought a ZVOX 450 on the basis of its claims, having never before heard the name, and I had hoped to make dialog more clear -- particularly punch-lines of jokes.  The directions claim it only takes 10 minutes to set up, but I spent 2 frustrating hours before calling ZVOX.  (To their credit, a live United States citizen answered the phone.)  I explained the sound continued to come from the TV speakers as well as the ZVOX causing an echo effect that made most conversation unintelligible.  After half an hour he succeeded in turning off the TV speakers off, but then the ZVOX speakers alone didn't sound any better.  Plus, the mute button no longer worked, so I could no longer avoid those noisy adverts for pills to avoid all sorts of ailments that no one really wants to hear about incessantly.  And certain other functions didn't work either, like the channel-switcher.  After three weeks of only half of what I enjoyed before getting the ZVOX, I called it quits and sent the ZVOX back.  Then I had no sound on my TV, so I had to call Comcast to repair it.  (They gave me a new remote, as the old one had been destroyed in the process of defeating the double speaker problem.  And through all of this the sound quality remained the same, with or without the ZVOX.  So save your money and a huge piece of space (the ZVOX 450 is REALLY big and heavy).  My TV is a four or five year old Samsung, incidentally.[EOS]

[BOS]This is a unique concept compared to a lot of other teething products.[SEP]you know ladies) before we go out later or something along those lines.[SEP]This is a unique concept compared to a lot of other teething products. There are plenty of really awesome necklaces that are baby safe for chewing and I utilize them a lot- [[ASIN:B00E7OXN22 Pendant Baby Teething Necklace - Non-Toxic Jewelry for Mom, Safe for Babies to Tug, Touch, and Chew! - Buy 1 Get 1 FREE!]]. It's a super convenient way to keep the teething toys with you at all times without worrying about them falling on the floor or getting thrown if you're out shopping etc.<br /><br />What makes this particular piece unique is that from a distance, you'd think it was actually jewelry. It's safe but it's multifaceted obviously so that makes it great for moms like me. Unless you're right on top of me you really can't tell it's beat up at all. It's great to know there's something I don't have to be embarrassed about if I forget to set it aside (we've all been there- puke on shirts...you know ladies) before we go out later or something along those lines.[EOS]

[BOS]This is our young Maine Coon's favorite food.[SEP]~ Kort[SEP]This is our young Maine Coon's favorite food. Okay, she likes snacks, and eats odd things like potato chips and green onion stalks. But when it comes to her primary diet, Hill's Ideal Balance Hairball Natural Chicken & Oats Recipe is her absolute favorite. For some reason, we've nicknamed them &#34;Peeblers&#34;. Believe it or not, she likes it more than canned food. I can't be more happy that we found a healthy food she enjoys, that helps keep the inevitable hairballs to a minimum. I know that this intended for adult cats, but don't tell her that!<br /><br />We have two older cats that like it, but not as much as she does. They'd rather have soft canned food, but won't turn their noses up if it is in the bowl. So as dry food goes, it gets high marks. The bag with a velcro closure is a nice touch as well. I just wish it wasn't quite so pricy.<br /><br />~ Kort[EOS]

[BOS]I finally got a chance to see this movie after seeing all the commercials for it.[SEP]Overall I would highly recommend seeing this movie![SEP]I finally got a chance to see this movie after seeing all the commercials for it. I figured though that the commercials held the best parts of the movie and I would not be impressed. If I could be any more wrong it would be impossible! Wow what a great movie! It is an absolutely hilarious Monster parody comedy all in one. Monsters afraid of Humans and Humans worshiping the monsters!<br /><br />The story is about Count Dracula holding up to his promise to protect his diseased wife and his daughter, Mavis. Count Dracula is deathly afraid of Humans and I will not spoil the why he is, but he is protecting Mavis from ever seeing them. He built a castle to keep her safe. Every year he invites all the monsters to his safe haven to celebrate Mavis's birthday. In the movie it is Mavis's (Selena Gomez's voice) 118th birthday, and she is ready to go out into the world and see things.<br /><br />After twists and turns and the Count trying to protect Mavis too much, Mavis finally meets a backpacking boy named Jonathan. Jonathan and her "Zing", and the rest I will leave up to the movie telling you what happens. It truly is a very funny and interesting movie.<br /><br />The comedy in this movie is very good not only for children, but adults too. I was very pleasantly surprised to see how good this movie is. It was one of the better animated movies I have seen in the past few months, and I will be watching it again.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend seeing this movie![EOS]

[BOS]Let me clarify that I am not a teacher, I have never played more than six months when I was 5.[SEP]I do enjoy it though I feel I will be purchasing something better in the future![SEP]Let me clarify that I am not a teacher, I have never played more than six months when I was 5. So to some people I don't know everything. This is just a review on this product of what I have found. I was hesitant about ordering this product. From all the bad reviews and different people were complaining about odds and ends. I chose to get the Black Mendini 4/4 MV solid wood violin. Let me tell you a few things that I questioned that no one had posted about. The violin does come with the strings already put in place with the pegs. You have to insert your bridge and tighten the pegs so that the bridge isn't going to fall out or anything. One thing people complained about was the pegs slipping. All I had to do was push and twist so that it tightened into the wood on the other end of the peg. I have listened to a lot of violinist and heard a lot of tuning things. I was able to tune my violin by ear. At first when you are trying to tighten the pegs so your bridge will stay in place, you need to be careful not to break the strings. Especially your littlest and thinest string. You have to move slowly and carefully. The rosin that came with mine was cracked and flakey. But you have to scratch it up a little bit to make it powdery anyways. If you take it straight out and try to play it you will get the worst sound. You need the rosin on the bow. and quiet a bit at first or you will get a cracky sound. Last night I was able to learn how to hold the bow, was able to play my open strings. and also learned the rest of the notes down the neck. The only thing I am worried about is I have already had two hairs fall out of my bow. I will see how it does over the next few weeks. If it loses to much then I will contact the seller since it is under warranty. I haven't tried out the shoulder rest yet. But if I do I will be sure to come back and update if it is good or bad like some people have said. Also Some people complained about the body being in bad shape, or the neck being crooked. Mine looks perfect. My neck is straight, and there isn't any buffs or marks or scratches anywhere. I am hoping for luck since I am 23 now and learning to play. I think I have a great start, It takes a lot of determination to get it all down!! Overall I would say this is a great beginners violin especially when you don't have 300 or more to put down on a violin that you may not continue to play! I do enjoy it though I feel I will be purchasing something better in the future![EOS]

(who doesnt haha) but adding the Flavor God Everything seasoning, to literally EVERYTHING has been a life changing experience for me! Its absolutely exceeds every expectation I had. I first came across their products on their Instagram account and was very intrigued. I saw so many photos shared of chicken, and other foods with this seasoning sprinkled on them. I saw a whole bunch of recipes that literally made my mouth water. I knew I had to try it!<br /><br />Once I ordered it I couldnt wait to get it, constantly seeing photos of delicious food with this added to the recipes I knew it was going to be out of the world. I love that this product is low in sodium and gluten free. Due to a thyroid disorder Ive had to change my diet drastically and it makes me happy knowing that I can sprinkle this seasoning onto food and actually enjoy my meal! I dont have to worry about my food tasting bland, I know I can always add this to everything! My boyfriend who is a very picky eater is obsessed with it too! The taste is just out of this world!<br /><br />This seasoning has so many good flavors packed into it. ( garlic, onion, cumin, paprika, etc. ) Ive recently started putting it on veggies such as potatoes and avocados, it makes all food so much more enjoyable.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this product!<br />Flavor god is an amazing company that is constantly expanding.

[BOS]I'm no plumber, but I play one around my house.[SEP]Do the PVC pipe work well and you're gonna love these.[SEP]I'm no plumber, but I play one around my house. So when my sink started gurgling and slurping and making strange noises, especially when I flushed the toilet, I started looking things up online. It turned out that I installed the sink without adequate air venting. Doh! Well, a few minutes with the PVC saw and that amazing, sniffy solvent and the problem was solved. I'm pretty much sold of AAVs like this one for venting in tight spaces.    This Oatey AAV is great because it works, but also because it'll take two sized of PVC pipe -- just flip around the adapter. I went with the 2" for better flow.     UPDATE: Since first publishing this review, I've now installed three more of these on various sinks. I now swear by these AAV units. Do the PVC pipe work well and you're gonna love these.[EOS]

What they have in common is that they LOVE these treats! Crazy love. The tails sweeping the ground, quivering with excitement kind of love. The treats get a 5 star PLUS rating.<br />However, the container is just kinda silly. The idea is that you place a treat on the pig's nose and push it in, it will fling it off into the room for the dog to catch. In our experience, it almost never worked. The nose would push in, but then not pop out. Or it would only push in part way, an then not pop at all. Just a gimmick that doesn't work.[EOS]

With all the arm movement we do, these gloves add an extra boost to help tone my arms. The size is perfect. I have small hands and it's hard to find gloves that won't fall off. But these are snug as a bug and the Velcro strap is a big help with my small wrists. The weight is distributed evenly so you won't hurt your wrists like those other weights that wrap around your wrists. The only reason I didn't give them a five star is because I couldn't find them heavier than 1 pound. I hope Everlast will make some in 2 or 3 pounds.

(Volume must be adjusted via your device.)<br /><br />I have had few issues with connectivity, although my Motorola Droid sometimes does not play well with this device. (I have had no issues connecting my Droid to other bluetooth speakers and headphones.) While it does not connect with the ease of some speakers I have used, it is also not a major inconvenience. Sometimes I have had to try several times before it will connect.<br /><br />Battery life is decent, and this will work for half a day on a single charge using it at full volume.<br /><br />Bottom line: This unit has excellent sound for the price, but there are better options. For example, [[ASIN:B00IY3152C Etekcity® Roverbeats T12 3.0+EDR Portable NFC Wireless Rechargeable Bluetooth Speaker With 3.5mm AUX Stero Audio, Enhanced Bass, up to 12 Hours Battery Life for Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops, and Many More Devices Red]][EOS]

[BOS]I've been worried about my little dog for a while since he likes to chew on really tough things like my door or my cabinet.[SEP]Now, he won't chew on anything harder than my shoes, which is another problem to deal with.[SEP]I've been worried about my little dog for a while since he likes to chew on really tough things like my door or my cabinet.

[BOS]I'm going to have to get an external streaming video product (Roku?[SEP]Roku here we come.[SEP]I'm going to have to get an external streaming video product (Roku?) because the "famed" Vizio Internet Apps are getting really long in the tooth, and there's no apparent update coming.  The Netflix app is so old it lacks all kinds of features that are commonplace with other Netflix boxes, like the ability to sequence to the next video in a series.  Each time we power up this puppy, we have to manually search through sometimes dozens of episodes we've already watched to get to the next one we haven't seen.  It doesn't even group the episodes into seasons (season 1, 2, etc.), you have to scroll through ALL of the episodes to get to the one you want.<br /><br />There are lots of other Netflix and Amazon gotcha's that make using it truly painful.  For example the Amazon app has no "My list", so you can't make any attempt at saving a favorite show for future viewing.  Ridiculous.<br /><br />It's not that I expect Vizio to compete head-on with Roku (for example) but they could at least try to keep current.<br /><br />As a plain old HD tv this unit is fine.<br /><br />My 2c.<br /><br />Further info, 9/16/2013: Just spoke with Vizo tech support.  According to him they have several different main versions of firmware, and they have to work "hand in hand" with each of the app providers (i.e. Netflix) to coordinate every update.  Long story short, they *may* get around to updating any particular firmware version at some point, but they are seriously behind at this time.  To me, sounds like a losing battle.  Roku here we come...[EOS]
[BOS]I knew we weren't paying top dollar so I didn't have high expectations but this failed on every level.[SEP]Waste of time, effort and $$.[SEP]I knew we weren't paying top dollar so I didn't have high expectations but this failed on every level. One of the lamp arms wasn't assembled tightly. So we needed to disassemble the fixture to find the nut to tighten ourselves. Then none of the arms are actually level so the lamp shades were all catawampus. We tried to right all the arms to level the top of the shades but it was like chasing cats. In the end we put it back in the box. I would return it but I had to destroy the packaging to get all the components out. Waste of time, effort and $$.[EOS]
