20982	__label2__	5	Y	Shoes	B00APWMC90	Vasque Women's Skadia Ultradry Snow Boot,Jet Black/White,10 M US	Great boot	Got these just in time to hike on snow-covered gravel road. They were warm and had great traction. Best of all, they are quick and easy to lace up- just wind them around the hooks and off you go. I sometimes wear a 9 1/2, but mainly a 10. I got the 10 and they fit great. There was no break-in needed- my feet felt fine after their first workout.

I highly recommend the new Tech Armor Anti-Fingerprint Screen Protector for my Ipad Mini tablet.  It is very easy to use and it works great.  Tech Armor has a lifetime replacement warranty and they have the best pricing online.  I would definitely recommend it!

I love cooking and this one is my best friend. With this I could do my chores without getting dirty.
11535	__label2__	5	N	Outdoors	B00RJM2HTE	Mountain House Chicken Fried Rice	Good Stuff!	This Mountain House &#34;Savor the Adventure&#34; freeze dried food bags are freeze dried meals where you simply add boiling water, let sit for a few minutes, and eat. They are convenient for hiking, travelling, emergencies (like power outages, natural disasters, etc). Because they are freeze dried and vacuum sealed, they have a very long shelf life (years). Make sure you remove the oxygen absorption pouch before adding water (it won't hurt if you forget and do it after, it's just more of a pain to find it).<br /><br />This pouch supposedly has 2.5 servings. You could probably get by feeding two people with this, I wouldn't go beyond that, especially if you are active (out hiking, etc). You get a decent chunk of protein (11 Grams per serving) and unlike the pro packs, the cholesterol is more manageable (100 mg).<br /><br />The food itself is actually pretty good, especially for what it is. It's not like a gourmet restaurant or anything but it tastes pretty good. If you keep these around for emergencies, it's definitely nice to have something that tastes good.
19511	__label2__	4	Y	Video Games	B005HN5LKY	Gen AC Adapter Power Supply Cord for Xbox 360 Slim	MY NEW POWER PAC	Works like a charm...it was packaged nicely and looked just like it appeared on the marketing page.  I like the price as well.
11498	__label2__	4	Y	Watches	B0058ZIOYG	Fossil Men's CH2782 Flight Brown Dial Watch	Somewhat Satisfied	"It's a Fossil. Pretty hard to go wrong - but, the watch arrived running. Doesn't that make it ""used?"" Everything inside the face is brown, so it's kind of hard to read, especially at night. That's my only real complaint.  It would be nice if it had luminous hands, or a back light (like Timex's ""indiglo"") to compensate for the lack of  clarity.  The watch band is stiff - will take some breaking in, like new shoes. I had a cuff watch band that works beautifully with this watch, making it a striking looking watch. But, again, it would be nice to have greater clarity in the watch face.  I have several Fossil's and they are well made. The vendor did finally get back to me regarding shipping. So, overall - I will give it a 4, but not a 5."
9852	__label1__	3	N	Shoes	B001GLGW0O	FASH Giraffe Print Faux Leather Tote Shoulder Handbag,Red,One Size	looks well made	I was initially quite pleased with bag. Stitching is neat, and the bag looks well made. . Packing had created a dent in the bag that is still there; I am hopeful it will eventually diminish as I use the purse. The major issue is the shoulder strap, its small.
12717	__label2__	5	Y	Home Improvement	B000Q5VMKG	First Alert CO615 Dual Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display	Don't be without one	Simple to install, just plug it in.  The batteries go under the LED in front of the unit.  You open the battery compartment by pulling the cover out and down, from the top front. I recommend this product.  Carbon Monoxide can kill you, you won't see it coming, hear or smell it.
4602	__label1__	5	N	Books	1610725557	PLACE Science (05) Exam Flashcard Study System: PLACE Test Practice Questions & Exam Review for the Program for Licensing Assessments for Colorado Educators (Cards)	Flash cards that give you everything you need	IF you want to have the details you need to study in one location, ready for you to study them whenever you have time, you should get these flash cards. You don't have to do any of the prep work because the flash cards have everything you need to know on one of them.  They're great because they're nice and small so you can take them with you and study them anywhere you go.  It's nice to have a card or two in your back pocket so you can pull it out wherever you are and get a little extra work in.
1456	__label1__	3	N	Video DVD	B0084IG7KC	The Hunger Games (Blu-ray + Digital Copy)	A bit too commercial for my own tastes	The book was fantastic. But I would rate the movie with just an 'okay'. Let me tell you why. It fails in delivering the emotions that you could feel when reading the book. The characters in this movie are crafted after the nowadays heroes theme. And that's too commercial for my tastes. Indeed, the film delivers excelent entertainment and the effects are very realistic. It's a good movie, but the book is better.
7283	__label1__	5	Y	Office Products	B00V3146BO	"Abdtech 130"" Mini LED Projector 800 Lumens Multimedia Beamer Portable Home Theatre Projectors"	Sparkling picture with mini projector!!	That's projector I look for, which is extremely suitable to office activities. This projector is easy to use, small and can be put to any places I want. With this one, I feel very confident when present a new ideal without getting technical problems. The picture is much better than others, crystal and doesn't make color errors. Great product and reasonable price!!<br />I will buy it again on demand and also highly recommend to others.

11807	__label2__	5	N	Camera	B00AR95ESC	Sony HDR-PJ790V High Definition Handycam Camcorder with 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Wow, what features!	This video camera is pretty freakin' amazing, I have to say. My last video camera was from years ago (so long that it used tape!), so this was my first experience with a digital video camera. I don't think I have to say I came away impressed.<br /><br />First of all, I wasn't looking forward to having to buy a bunch of storage for a digital video camera. Storage is expensive, plus keeping track of cards is just annoying. Well, imagine my surprise when I discovered that this video camera has almost 100 GB of internal storage! That's enough for almost 40 hours of recording, which is more than I'd use it before pulling the data off.<br /><br />When you take it out of the box, the way the camera is built is a little disconcerting. This camera has pretty incredible image stabilization, which prevents your video from reflecting the natural shakiness of your arm. But to do that, the internal bits of the camera float around inside. Basically, when you take it out and hear things thumping around in the camera you're probably going to think it's broken. But no, that's how it's supposed to be, and you'll get used to it.<br /><br />My favorite feature of the camera is its built-in projector. No longer do you have to wait to unload video from the memory card before watching! The projector is such a great feature, and it works very well. Image quality is sharp and it's pretty intuitive to use.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed with this camera. It is on the expensive side, but you're getting a lot for your money here, as this thing is feature-packed.

15521	__label2__	2	Y	Outdoors	B00DUHLIRY	Cloudnine Sand Anchor	Our friends had a similar item that was made of much thicker plastic and worked much better. I would not recommend this item	Bent on the very first day of use.  Our friends had a similar item that was made of much thicker plastic and worked much better. I would not recommend this item.

10094	__label1__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B001R2I12Y	Squier 030-1600-032 SE Electric Guitar and Amplifier Starter Pack, Brown Sunburst (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Solid build. Good tuning. Easy to learn with.	For the money, this guitar looks and plays great. Tuning is a little tricky, but it comes with a halfway decent tuner to help you along at first. My suggestion, though would be to pick up a better one at your earliest convenience. The guitar plays really well, and sounds pretty decent through the little amp that's included. If you should hear any buzzing, though, the recommendation is that you take it to your nearest Guitar Center or music store and have a professional look it over. It might need a little bit of adjustment. Other than that, it's worth it if your just starting out.
2499	__label1__	4	Y	Camera	B003F7DWH8	Case Logic DCB-302 Compact  Case for Camera - Black	I like it	I purchased this kind of case with regard to my personal camera, it really is ideal and it has a great high quality. Just a little bit small I guess but the delivery had been punctually which is ideal.
338	__label1__	4	Y	Wireless	B00NHG0374	Coromose Smile LED USB Charger Cable for Samsung Galaxy S3 S4 I9500 (Hot Pink)	Good quality!	Good quality USB cable, such as a color change indication can tell at a glance if the full load management, but also a very reasonable price, I will have a time when they do so.
14346	__label2__	5	Y	Sports	B007SYJ6VA	Armasight Nemesis6x-ID Gen 2+ Night Vision Rifle Scope w/6x Magnification	Worth it	I originally bought this scope from Wayfair on amazon, and after the placing the order, it was brought to my attention that Wayfair was selling the Gen 2 model rather than the Gen 2+. Over email, I let them know that I was not interested in the Gen 2 model and did not wish to continue with the order. In the meantime, the product had already shipped, and the charge to my card was processed. Long story short, Wayfair was definitely WAY FAIR about it! They got the product back before it got to me and promptly refunded the money. This easily could have turned into a hassle with a significant chunk of change, but it didnt. I would definitely consider doing business with Wayfair again.<br />Now, on to the product review. I ended up getting the Armasight Nemesis6x-ID Gen 2+ Night Vision Rifle Scope w/6x Magnification, as advertised, from optics planet. This scope is phenomenal!!! I have a lower end Gen 1 monocular, and compared to that, the difference is literally night and day. I set up with it the other night, with about 25% of the moon lit up, and watched some coyotes about 400 yards away. I could nearly count their teeth!!! The only downside to this scope is that I can see farther than I feel confident shooting with the gun I have it mounted on.<br />Before the moon comes out, when its pitch black, it still provides a decent picture. With the IR spotlight that comes with it, you can see about 100 yards with no other light, as long as youre not getting a reflection from nearby objects.<br />All in all, the Armasight Nemesis6x-ID Gen 2+ Night Vision Rifle Scope w/6x Magnification is worth it.

8892	__label1__	5	N	Camera	B00JXPO5N6	Aluratek ADMPF310F 10-Inch Digital Photo Frame with 4GB Built-In Memory (Black)	Not just a frame...	I own a sandwich shop and tried this digital frame to display my daily specials and loved the clarity of the screen so much that I chose to keep it on display. I have customers who always compliment how up to date I am with technology and all it took was this great frame! It was easy to load my files and really like that I could include the background music to add that extra touch! I definitely recommend this digital frame to all business owners!
7353	__label1__	5	N	Camera	B00TGZYJ8O	Wireless IP Camera SUSPEND	Wonderful Camera	This camera with great picture and video, all the time, it will helps us know when someone is home.<br /><br />The camera works exactly as expected, it has great video quality and it has lot of features: you can view the camera through a web page and even operate it, you can create different accounts with access levels (maybe you want someone to see it but not move the camera), you can set at what time it should start recording with infra-red (or let it figure it out by itself), and you can add many different cameras and monitor all of them from the same interface!<br /><br />I have an android phone, iPad and iPhone in my household. So far all of them worked well. Usually IOS version gets all the developer attention. Android app works really good I was able to do presets, turn on/off motion sensing and configure various things. We are REALLY satisfied.
18041	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B001IHXFQK	Scalp Massager by Body Back Company	Head-gasm!!	Okay, I bought this for a friend thinking it would be a novelty gift.  I tried it, loved it, and bought another one for me!  I probably look a little funny using it, but it feels fantastic.  I have my head massager on top of my nightstand.  A couple of swipes of this on my head and I'm ready for bed.  This is not to be used in front of others, as your friends will see your groan and roll your eyes as you use this.  Yes, it feels that good.
15198	__label2__	3	Y	Tools	B0009HM5OI	DEWALT DW292 7.5-Amp 1/2-Inch Impact Wrench with Detent Pin Anvil	Disappointed	I was disappointed with this drill couldn't even loosen lug bolts, this has 375ft lbs I believe,  you at 500 to 700ft lbs to crack any bolt.
17190	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B00063435O	Natural Balance Original Ultra Whole Body Health Chicken, Salmon & Duck Formula Wet Cat Food, 6-Ounce Can (Pack of 24)	my cats LOVE this...for less	I am so happy to find this cat food on Amazon. I re-checked one more time at the store that stares with P and has the word Smart in it JUST to be sure The prices they sell this food for is still more...when they have it in stock. YUP! Still about $37.00 for a case and you have to buy 2 to get free shipping! NOT a deal in my book. even if you get a $5.00 off coupon
19673	__label2__	5	Y	Wireless	B00B1M1B3G	Wireless Bluetooth Speaker- BLKBOX POP360 Hands Free Bluetooth Speaker - for iPhones, iPads, Androids, Samsung and all Phones, Tablets, Computers (Bumpin' Black)	Cool Little Speaker	Really like this little speaker.  Great sound for such a small device.  Much better than listening to music through the speakers on my phone!
13403	__label2__	5	Y	Sports	B000FML7SW	BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band	Outstanding cure for tennis elbow	Worked so well!  I don't play tennis, but I hyperextended my arm in my sleep and couldn't figure out how to get rid of the pain in my elbow.  This was perfect!  Easy to use, stays in place, and a great fit.  It did get hot and a bit sweaty while I was out running...but then again, I was hot and sweaty everywhere.
11027	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B008J46DNC	Banana Bread - Medium FREE SHIPPING on orders $25 or more, mix and match with our other delicious flavors	I'm warning you	Do NOT put a loaf of banana bread in front of me or it WILL be gone!  I'm *that* much of a banana bread lover!  This White Post Farm banana bread is the stuff I've always admired the most, but I'm particularly fond of the homemade stuff too.  Seriously, an Amish store downtown was selling several loaves of banana bread in a giant bin.  I noticed them the moment I walked inside.  I nearly cried with excitement... and cried more when I came back a few weeks later and they were all gone. Banana bread is my best and only friend.  It just goes down my throat so well.
18139	__label2__	4	Y	Kitchen	B000N2TYOS	Primula Classic Glass 8-Cup Coffee Press with Black Handle	Works great. Glass is thick enough. Boiling water is not a problem.	I was a bit worried since a lot of reviews on coffee presses talked about thin glass/breaking with hot water...Im not sure what could make it better, because the grinds do come through as well as the really fine grounds. Not a whole lot, but I just pour it through a coffee filter and all is good. Im not sure if all coffee presses let though a few grounds. The only down side for me is there wasn't any measurement on the glass to see how much water I was pouring in. I just broke out my black sharpie and fixed that. Good enough product.
3069	__label1__	1	Y	Office Products	B00I0A41V6	"1"" Inch Round Metallic Blue Color Code Dot Stickers - 1,000 Circle Labels Per Roll"	Not as shown	The color is not exact to the picture shown which is extremely disappointing. How can you sell something when it is way off from the description. Completely throws off what i was going to use them for.
17571	__label2__	5	Y	Watches	B002SSUQFG	Seiko Men's SNK809 Seiko 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch with Black Canvas Strap	Nice Watch	What needs to be said about a Seiko 5? The watch is automatic, would survive an EMP, and is very stylish. I got a couple of them at this great price!
4269	__label1__	5	Y	Sports	B00UIBB5TG	Survival Knife, Rescue Survival Knife: Best 3-in-1 Tactical Pocket Folding Knife with LED Light & Magnesium Fire Starter;Camping/Hunting/Hiking/Outdoor; Quality Stainless Steel	LED Light is great	Ordered this knife a few days ago and it came earlier than expected. The LED light is what sets it apart from other knives in the same price bracket. It was sharper than I expected based on the previous reviews - maybe I just got a good one
8912	__label1__	5	Y	Automotive	B00A3SU7NO	Niceeshop(tm) Mini 45x 2-led Pocket Microscope Magnifier Loupe with LED Light Adjustable Illuminator + Niceeshop Cable Tie	I really mean it.

10409	__label1__	5	N	Watches	B0049HSJ76	Casio G-Shock GD-100-1B Watch	looks great	I just wanted a tough digital watch that would tell me what time it was. This was the perfect one for me. Looks great, low maintenance, rough and tumble exterior, what's not to love?  Also, I actually think that since G-Shocks last forever, they may have just redefined how heirlooms are supposed to look like.
18795	__label2__	3	Y	Grocery	B0055T5VB4	Miracle Noodle Shirataki Angel Hair Pasta and Shirataki Fettuccini, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3 Each) - 6 Total	Noodles	I expected something else.  I have to cook them so long in order for me to eat them.  They're rubbery.
10665	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B00D2D1WVI	Jesse Stone: The Complete Set	Soulful Detective Series	If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.<br /><br />Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work.  Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her?  Will he be able to stop drinking?  Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job?  Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?<br /><br />In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.<br /><br />In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real.  Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease.  You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself.  The secondary characters are strong.  You don't feel like you are watching a show.  You feel like it's real life.  And you care about the characters.  Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.<br /><br />This is the kind of series you could watch every year.  Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode.  We hope Selleck is right. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do.

First of all, they look so stylish. I love the black vibe from it all. The blade cover for the knife is awesome so I can store it away in my drawer and not cut myself trying to get it. The are both lightweight and very easy to use. I find the grip comfortable on both handles. I love that I don't have to sharpen this knife as it keeps its razor sharp edge and will not wear out. I find this ceramic knife to be more sanitary than my others. All it needs is a quick rinse in between cutting different food items. I also know that this won't rust out. I love the price tag on this knife because they usually go for a lot more. I'm very happy with this knife and plan to expand my collection of ceramic knives for cooking.

So my review is 100% my honest opinion
2201	__label1__	4	N	Toys	B002NPBT50	Perplexus Original Maze Game by PlaSmart, Inc. (Discontinued by manufacturer)	solid 10 min of quiet time	This maze was a part of the present my daughter got for her 9th birthday. She was really trying and was really persistent for 10 minutes straight. But then somehow it starts getting on he nerves and she is ready to through it into the wall. It's funny to watch her being so frustrated with... herself. But again, I think it makes her more patient with every try. She doesn't quit. Love that there are toys that develop those good qualities in kids.
14269	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B000FL7C82	Carnivale: Season 2	Great series!!!!	The dvds arrived in the excellent condition that they were promised.  Price was good, also.  We watched these on netflix and were sorry that only 2 seasons were made by HBO.  A super change from alot of the &#34;stuff&#34; that is described as entertainment nowadays.  Wish there were more episodes.....
15644	__label2__	4	Y	Baby	B00IJEFH52	Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Sensitive Tummy Starter Pack, Clear, 3 Pack	Go for it.	I ordered it after reading several review.

Please share some info if someone has also experienced the same.
1986	__label1__	3	N	Toys	B000BNB0LO	Chinese Jumprope (Colors May Vary)	Ripped	Got these for my daughters who are obsessed with the bracelet making trend, it was an okay price, quite a few were broken or snapped. It's not a purchase I would repeat.

You can use it in the garage you can use it in the home.  I use it to transfer large batches of food into storage containers without spilling all over the place.<br /><br />It's pretty large but guess what?  It fits in my dishwasher and it seems to be dishwasher safe.  It didn't melt anyway.<br /><br />Large enough to wear as a hat if you wanted to.  Just sayin'.

11936	__label2__	5	N	Luggage	B00LPC4B8E	Double Dutch Club Water Color Stripe Warm 20 Inch Hardside, Pink, One Size	Flashy and functional!	Wow this luggage is flashy! The wife likes it very much, the colors are bright and cutesy. The wheels roll well and the handle pulls up and down smoothly. This luggage also includes a protective bag to help prevent scratches on the shell during travel which is an excellent plus to keep this luggage looking pretty.<br /><br />If you want something that stands out in the airport, this is the bag to use!!!

The process takes a long time, but it was much easier than I expected, and the final result is worth it. I don't think I'll ever go back to buying it in a box!

The handles or wheels end up giving issues sooner than expected, however, this stroller is definitely more quality.  I'm going on 1 year and am purchasing this stroller for a friend and I stand by my purchase.

18426	__label2__	5	Y	Tools	B0033YLEGO	Howard Leight MAX-1 Foam Ear Plugs Uncorded, 20 Piece	Best earplugs I've used	It's hard to review ear plugs, because... well, they do one thing, but these are quite good. They are the super soft squishy type, which is good because they don't hurt my ears as much after four or five hours in. I work on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, so it's pretty bloody loud where I work, and these combined with the mickey mouses (well, the new mickey mouses, which I suppose we can't call mickey mouses any more) make the flight deck a very ear-friendly place. They will not stop you from getting blown down the flight deck a few hundred feet by exhaust, however, so there's that.<br /><br />The NRR of 33 is about the highest you can get with non-fitted ear plugs. The squishiness of them means installing them can be a bit tricky, as you have to use a gradual pinch-roll method to squeeze them into shape without creating creases that make an imperfect seal. Also you need to pull up your ear with your other hand if you want to get them in deep enough to make a good seal. Don't do that, and you get maybe 20dB max of protection.

Wasn't hard to clean just rinsed in hot water but make sure you rinse right after use so none of the dough hardens on the spikes and it will be simple clean up!
19318	__label2__	5	Y	Furniture	B001EQN52Y	9pcs Contemporary Walnut Counter Height Dining Table & 8 Stools Set	Love the set!	I received my dining set about a month ago, but just got it put together & set up. I am extremely happy with the set so far. The instructions were clear & easy to follow, assembly was very simple & went smoothly, I had not only all the hardware I needed, but also a few extra pieces when I was finished. Love the color, although it was about a shade lighter than I expected, probably due to differences in monitor color. The set feels very sturdy & looks gorgeous in our dining room. The only negative is that I was given a 3 day window for delivery & only got about 20 minutes notice before delivery, so was not able to be there. Fortunately my neighbor was home & able to sign for it. The driver was nice enough to place the pallet on my concrete patio, so that was helpful. Set was very well packaged, boxes were well packed & the whole thing was palleted. It is VERY heavy & awkward, so I would recommend paying a bit more & having the delivery person bring it in the house for you.
12693	__label2__	3	N	Automotive	B003UT6LCO	Fumoto F-103 Engine Oil Drain Valve	installed on Highlander 2010	"first-time oil changer here, so decided to make job easier in the future and installed F-103S (one with small nipple)<br /><br />Observations:<br /><br />1) Don't get F-103S, get regular F-103 - more then enough.<br /><br />2) it sticks out by ~1/4"" - 3/8"" from protected bottom level. Safe in day-to-day driving, but I would think twice about jumping sidewalks or driving over rocks.<br /><br />3) this is quality piece, NOT some junk.<br /><br />4) don't worry about valve opening by itself due to driving - highly unlikely.<br /><br />5)it is made from soft bronze, so go light on torque<br /><br />6) last, but main reason for taking down 2 stars: final position, after tightening to specs, is NO GOOD: it leaves ball part of the piece in lowest point, so it sticks out, and I could not find a way to move it to the highest point without either over tightening or under tightening. Washers of different thickness would probably let you adjust final position, but i didn't have that option.<br /><br />Overall, come prepared, buy couple of washers and you will be fine."

11546	__label2__	3	N	Books	1612183727	The Well of Tears (The Dream Stewards)	Shoots for epic. Doesn't quite make it	This is a fairly entertaining retread of familiar territory, and I did find parts to be extremely moving (especially when dealing with loss).<br /><br />However, the book failed to impress me for a number of reasons:<br />1/ A slew of cliched situations and plot devices (ancient prophecy, circle of power, unnamed evil afoot, etc. )<br />2/ The characters were entirely one dimensional, and it was apparent at first encounter who was good and who was evil. No shades of grey.<br />3/ Each character's motivation was similarly obvious. Greed/power for the evil, and duty/honor for the good.<br />4/ The major plot line was extremely weak, was resolved with minimal fuss, and ended with a just-as-weak cliffhanger.<br /><br />This is not epic GRRM, and neither is it even close to the more mass market efforts by Goodkind. What it is, is a lazy read with minimal fuss and excitement, that won't raise your pulse rate as you read it.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars for writing style, 2 stars for content, and rounded up.<br /><br />Happy Reading!

14595	__label2__	4	Y	Outdoors	B001OPH29W	Liberty Mountain Nylon Gaiter (Black)	Gaiter Review - Keeping Dry	I purchased the Gaiters as Christmas gifts last year so my daughter and I can enjoy snowshoeing without becoming cold and miserable with wet legs and feet.  Unfortunately, Mother Nature conspired to not snow very much here in southern Nevada last winter and limited our time in the snow.  This year; however, is a different story. A friend and I traveled to Bryce Canyon and Cedar Breaks National Monument during Veteran's Day weekend.  We drove into a significant snow storm and after the weather cleared we hiked in fresh snow at Cedar Breaks.  Long story short, I'm glad we packed the gaiters for the trip.  Cedar Break's recieved over two feet snow during the storm and got the chance to use the gaiters over our hiking boots.  Overall, these gaiters did the trick during the hiking at 10,000ft keeping us dry in deep snow - these gaiters ride high up to the knee which is perfect for tall folks, like me.  The only miss with these gaiters are the strapping mechanism going under the boots, essentially, a string that needs to knotted.  It was a little challenging squaring away the knot when the air temperature was around 0 dgs, but, we were able to get the gaiters secured and we move about the mountain with the greatest of easy and comfort.  Good product for those who are outdoor types and need to keep dry in wet/snow conditions.
6602	__label1__	5	N	Camera	B00JGZQ17Q	Channel Master DVR+ Bundle - subscription free digital video recorder with web features and channel guide (CM7500BDL2)	Read this before you purchase an antenna DVR	I am giving this DVR 5 stars simply because it does what it is supposed to do reliably.  I have tried almost every DVR that claims to do the same thing.  Let me tell you, the only other one on the market that comes close is the TiVo.  In fact, the TiVo is a better choice If you are looking for more features/bells and whistles and don't mind paying the monthly fee.  I also own a TiVo and to be honest, I like it better primarily because it has Netflix, but I think the DVR+ is a better overall performing unit and would choose it over TiVo and that's why I bought this one because I'm not interest in paying 14 bucks a month to have access to Netflix.  My Roku box does that just fine.<br /><br />I have owned it for several months now and day in and day out it does what it is supposed to do just like I was used to with my old satellite DVR.  The features are on par with most cable or satellite DVR experiences.  If you have ever used one of those this works just the same except for one feature.  This unit lacks the ability to omit repeats in series recordings.  I was told by Channel Master that this was designed this way because if you are not connected to the internet then the box does not receive the information from the broadcaster if it is new or a repeat.  They told me they had a lot of requests for this and looking into adding this capability for those users who are connected to the internet.  The only other thing I would complain about is the remote control.  It is not comfortable In the hand as most cable/satellite remotes because it is thin and the DVR playback buttons are on the bottom of the remote making it a two hand process to jump commercials.  This is not a deal breaker though, you get use to it.  And if you can't get use to it, a universal remote is always an option.<br /><br />If you own an antenna and want a DVR that works like the one you use to have with cable or satellite, the DVR+ is the best bang for the buck.  The other units on the market just don't stack up the same.  Some do not include a remote and require a tablet to control (cumbersome!), others only have a single tuner so you can only record one show at a time, none have an on-screen guide as robust as the DVR+ without paying a fee and last but not least they are not near as simple to use, at least the several different units I have tried.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that I have already had two software updates in the few months that I have owned it. (Yay!  They are making it better).  Plus I have been told that the have a whole slew of internet content coming later this year.(Will see if that pans out)<br /><br />If you want a reliable antenna DVR without monthly fee's, this is the one to buy.  Don't waste your money on others like I did, spend a little extra dough and buy this one.  In the Antenna DVR department, you truly do get what you pay for.

14861	__label2__	5	Y	Electronics	B00HTPHK5W	Photive BTH3 Over-The-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Built-in Mic and 12 Hour Battery. Includes Hard Travel Case.	Great purchase!	So, I got these to take on vacation, so I could listen to my music without disturbing others and I love them. When turned on, they have a blue light that blinks every few seconds, but I asked and that did not bother those around me, and I can't see it unless I'm in front of a mirror or in a dark room. I'm no audiophile, but the bass sounds solid to me and the mids and highs are crisp enough for me. I have not had to charge them since the initial charge, and that was two weeks ago. I listen for 1-3 hours a day. The controls are not as intuitive as I'd like, simply because they are exactly the same on each side, so if I forget which side the volume is on I can accidentally skip forward or back a track by using the those controls on the other side. They are very comfortable, and I wear glasses, even, but after about 3 hours I'm ready to take them off. I've taken calls on them and the person on the other end says it sounds fine, but it sounds a little funny to me because my voice is muffled and I'm always afraid I'm talking really loudly. I'm really happy with them.

I have oily and acne-prone skin. I also get hormonal breakouts quite often thanks to my PCOS. I've tried moisturizer after moisturizer with some good, though mostly bad results; finding a good one is so hard for me. This one is definitely my new favorite!!<br /><br />It's very light, has a pleasant scent, does NOT break me out and has awesome ingredients. A little goes a long way, so I can see this jar easily lasting me 2-3 months. Plus, after a long day, my face doesn't look all greasy - like it often done with other moisturizers. To me, this is a sure sign that it helps to reduce oil production.<br /><br />I will be purchasing more ASAP; I don't want this to go away on me, so I plan to stock up. I also plan to check out more of C. Booth's products. If they're anything like this, then I'll switch out all of the products I use for them.

I had a the same design for my old phone. Had to shop around to find one with elastic in the band instead of the cheap, all neoprene ones. Neoprene doesn't have much stretch and either had to be tightened to tourniquet-tight or would pop loose. I'm not a big weightlifter and don't have big biceps. This still adjusts to fit me. It has three Velcro patches, so it can expand to fit a huge bicep. A smaller woman could trim one of the velcro sections off and it would still be secure, but you'd lose one of tbe reflective tabs. I used the previous case daily on my bike commute and it has held up flawlessly for over a year, so I expect the same thing here. Materials and construction seem the same, which is to say very good.<br /><br />The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is the fingerprint reader. It doesn't work through the screen cover. I was pretty sure it wouldn't and I could cut a hole for it...especially since the S5 is water resistant, but a cutout option would be perfect.

9039	__label1__	5	N	Video Games	B00KWJ4JW4	Final Fantasy Type-0 HD - PlayStation 4	Wonderful	This is the best final fantasy since FFX. The graphics are good. The characters themselves are brilliant the enviroments are well done. Yes a lot of the none important characters have psp graphics with HD gloss but tbh it doesn't matter they have so little screen time.  This is a war story with politics, backstabbing, and requires the player to have some intelligence with regards to how wars were fought. i.e WW1 and WW2. No I'm not saying go read them and you'll understand Type 0 but a lot of what people are saying is confusing just makes me laugh at their stupidity.  The Story Is brilliant: Let me just say this. If you don't get the story (As I've found it very very easy to follow) your stupid. Drop the game and go play hello kitty.  The amount of content in here, and the fact that it was originally a PSP title, it blows my mind. Awesome storyline, fun combat, and a great cast of characters. It's a must buy for any FF fan and anyone who wants to try out a fun action JRPG. True fan with the cash, can pick up one of the bundles like this one: http://fave.co/1bKMyKr  Trust me if you are a FF fan or Fan of FFX and FFVII your going to completely love this game.  What I can't understand is characters I find so funny like nine are being called annoying. Guys stop trying to find the reason of life in FF go outside get a life and stop taking it so seriously.  As for the critics reviews they are dead wrong and they will live to regret it. Look at destiny they did they stupid &#34;We've taken a few classes in good story writing and read some books there fore we know what we're talking about&#34; **** Gave the game a terrible score and it won a bafta.  How many hours have I played 22 hours yes. And what's amazing is that all 14 characters feel OP they all so good. I can hardly (acutally I can't) find a bad team make up. The character design is just amazing.  The reviewing industry is in shambles and the fact that this game is 74 on metacritc just proves it. It should have universial acclaim.  Look SE well done with this game it's amazing and thank you for giving me another real FF game  In the end if you're not at least checking this game out, your'e missing out! http://fave.co/1bKMGcQ
13092	__label2__	4	N	Home Improvement	B00IJHI6YI	Moen S3946SRS Transitional Deck Mounted Soap Dispenser, Spot Resist Stainless	Clean lines, functional	This Moen Transitional Deck Mounted Soap Dispenser Faucet in spot resistant, brushed stainless steel is beautiful, clean looking. I used it to replace a very old, no longer used dispenser. After it was in, it really cleaned up the look of the sink area. No soap bottles! Yay!<br /><br />So, like the faucet I installed recently, the actual installation of this dispenser is a breeze. That is, AFTER you remove the old unit. I had the same problem as with the faucet: unscrewing the old rusted nut (plastic disc screw like the one that comes with this soap dispenser but with metal ring under it????). I finally got it out with a hammer/chisel combo (I can't even explain this here). But once that was out and I did a quick scrub of the opening and surface, it took less than five minutes to install. The faucet in this particular sink is not a Moen but it is brushed stainless so it matches perfectly.<br /><br />To refill, you lift up the top and pour. Each pump provides enough soap to wash a substantial number of dishes. I guess you could also use this for hand soap if you wash everything in a dishwasher.<br /><br />It's a lovely, clean-looking unit but $100+ for a soap dispenser boggles the mind. I had to remove a star for the price but really, it's most definitely a five-star product.
11446	__label2__	5	N	Watches	B0055QIN62	Invicta Men's 1254 Sea Spider Stainless Steel Mechanical Skeleton Watch with Black Band	Huge!  .. Very Striking	This watch is an eye catcher.  It's big and beefy and heavy... you know you are wearing a timepiece.  Everyone who noticed my new watch was asking about it and it really sets off a casual outfit.  Pros: Cool composite band - very trendy, but cool black. Skeleton see-through is very detailed and jeweled Waterproof, so no worries in common usage around water.  Cons: Big -- not for tiny man arms. Must wind....  Perhaps I've gotten too used to self winding Clasp can be difficult to open, but it never accidentally pops.  Update 6/2015 -- I've had this watch for a long time now and it still keeps time and looks like it did on day one.  It's striking -- I get a lot of comments on this watch, much more than any other watch I own.   It really has a great look and complements casual and business casual well. I've had to maintain the band's screws to keep them tight, recently using a threadlock gel to ensure they stay in without risk.  The bezel has zero marks on it and the glass is unscratched.    That's saying a lot -- with its size, it has taken a few impacts catching edges or doorframes.   The Skeleton nature of the face is intricate with its gems and must be what draws people to the face... either way, I don't have its equal on my nightstand and it brings me to looking at some of the Invicta Reserves as a future investment.   I'm very satisfied with this watch.

I wasn't sure if I needed these but with a trip coming up I ordered them with hopes that it would make packing (a task I dread) easier. When they arrived I was excited at how nice these packing cubes actually were.<br /><br />The zippers are strong, the color is vibrant and the material is lightweight but strong and the stitching is durable. I love that they have handles and that they are double stitched for easy no worry carrying.<br /><br />I like the mesh on the front so you can see what is packed. The Shoe bag is a great size, I fit 6 pairs of adult shoes and could have fit in 1 or 2 more. I also found the shoe bag can double as a laundry bag when traveling.<br /><br />The varying sizes make for great organization and a number of different uses. I found that the two bigger sizes were great to use for clothing. After my flight, my clothes were less wrinkled than usual because they didn't slide all over the suitcase. The smaller sizes were great for keeping my family's medications neat and handy in my carry on and for personal care items and electronic accessories and cords.<br /><br />I am very happy with these packing cubes and wonder how I ever packed before without them. It's a great way to pack your things neatly and be able to find them quickly. A definite must have for travelers, whether you travel frequently or only every so often!

With this device I can run excel sheets and browse the web all while running a bunch of programs in the background.
17777	__label2__	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B00DG6FOV0	VIZIO S3820W-C0 38-inch 2.0 Home Theater Sound Bar with Integrated Deep Bass	Another great Vizio product.	After trying several small bluetooth speakers to use in the kitchen, I decided it was time for an upgrade and buy a unit the delivered the volume and sound quality I wanted.  Boy am I not the least bit disappointed!!  This bad boy fills the room with crisp clear sound.  I had an issue with the remote not working after we had a power outage.  A brief online chat with the Vizio tech had it working in under a minute.  This is my second Vizio purchase, the other being a flat screen TV.  Very pleased!!
4798	__label1__	5	N	Books	1781162646	Joyland (Hard Case Crime)	All-time favorite	This is one of my all-time favorite books ever, not just of the ones that Steve King wrote. I wasn't a fan of some of the things that he created, but I know a good story when I've read it.
16686	__label2__	4	Y	Jewelry	B0039ONWQI	Bling Jewelry Obsession Handcuff Steel Bracelet Secret Shades 8.5in	Great bracelet	I love the chain,and the cuffs themselves appear to be sturdy and look great.  Size could be just a bit larger. The bracelet is a bit on the tight side. It doesn't give much slack at all. The cuffs don't lay flat, and with the snugness of the fit, it can be uncomfortable at times. Just a warning if you have larger wrists.

12399	__label2__	5	N	Luggage	B00KA2X4QK	Kenneth Cole Reaction Easy To Remember, Black, One Size	Incredible Utility and Luxury	The Kenneth Cole Reaction is an outstanding computer bag, a vast improvement over any I've had before (Targus, etc). The quality manufacture is obvious at once in terms of the stitching, zippers, and the other materials, and it is very well padded.<br /><br />The bag easily holds everything I need with me, including my Kindle, my Samsung Galaxy Tablet (in a special sleeve), a slender paperback book, pens, micro-recorder, etc. I could easily add my smart phone to the mix if necessary, though I generally carry that on my person.<br /><br />I hauled this bag along with me the other day and it fit very comfortably on my back. Best of all, when I set it down, it sat upright without threat of falling over, making it easy to retrieve the contents, unlike my old messenger-style bag which had to be laid on its side when not in use.<br /><br />I used to live in fear of my computer being damaged because of the flimsy nature of my bag, making me reluctant to haul it around, but no longer.<br /><br />Some of its advertised features (and my comments):<br /><br />*1680d Nylon<br /><br />*Expansion Feature For Added Carrying Capacity. Easy Access Zipper Pocket And Soft Lined Zipper Pocket To Hold Digital Media Or Other Valuables. Front Zip Down Pocket Includes An Extensive Organizer That Will Hold A Variety Of Business Essentials.<br /><br />*Designed With Checkpoint Friendly/EZ-Scan Feature Which Complies With TSA Guidelines So Your Laptop Does Not Need To Be Removed When Passing Through Airport Security Checkpoints, Allowing You To Get On Your Way Faster. I don't travel often but I can see where this would be an incredibly useful feature.<br /><br />*Front Compartment Contains A Padded iPad/Tablet Pocket, A Full Length Open Top Pocket, And A Zippered Mesh Pocket. This is a great feature. I could not have safely put my tablet into my old bag, let alone a Kindle on top of that. Now I can carry both with me safely.<br /><br />*EZ-Scan Section Includes Three Zippered Organizer Pockets. Rear Compartment Is Padded To Hold Most Laptops With Up To A 15.6 inch Screen . High Tech Double Density Foam Padding For Extra Laptop Protection.<br /><br />*Side Exterior Features A Zipper Pocket And A Mesh Open Top Beverage Holster. Padded Top Handle And Air Mesh Back Panel That Will Attach To Most Luggage Upright Handles For Hands Free Carrying. You have to love a beverage holster. The top handle is very comfortable.<br /><br />*Ergonomic Adjustable Backpack Straps With Sternum Strap. As I said, this is very comfortable and the sternum strap is great. I could carry this thing for a long time without experiencing discomfort. The weight is very well distributed.<br /><br />Yes, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for with this bag. I would have hesitated spending this much on a bag sight unseen but if you don't trust my review, find one of these in a store and look at it, Pick it up, examine it. You will be won over.

I have purchased high dollar camers for my business, and this one tops all of them. I am used to spending $5,700 and more for camers. This one does a better job than any of the other ones I own. The customer service is OUTSTANDING! When I first got my camera, there was an issue with the camera head. I called customer service (Tennessee AMERICANS that you can understand) and they emailed me a ups label. I shipped it to them (no charge to me), Within three days, they resolved the problem and sent it back to me. I have had this camera for four months now, no more issues, and it works great! Best camera I have ever had! I use it for sewer lines. I am thinking of purchasing another one for an inspection camera (non sewer use).

For now they will do... I will look around and see what else I can find.
11717	__label2__	3	N	Beauty	B008GSY7UM	Jerdon JGL10W Euro Tri-Fold Lighted Mirror with 5x Magnification, 4-Light Settings, White Finish	A nice to have item, but not one we'd purchase on our own...	"Via the Amazon Vine program, I decided to get the Jerdon JGL10W Euro Tabletop Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror for my wife to try out. The magnification mirror we currently have in the bathroom is not real nice, and I thought this might be a good improvement. We found it has some nice features, but I'm not sure if it will end up being something that's used continuously.<br /><br />The magnification works well, and it works for both close-up jobs (like removing something from an eye) and makeup. She also liked the different lighting options. It's amazing how different the same look appears under various types of lighting. The styling was so-so, and a bit bulky to just leave on the vanity. The description talks about using it for travel, but I'm not quite sure I'd want to mess with it in a suitcase. The side mirrors fold down with no securing mechanism, so that's not very convenient if you move it on and off the vanity. As noted in other reviews, the item that seems to make the least sense is that the bulbs can't be replaced. You're basically risking a $60 purchase on a $2 light bulb.<br /><br />While it's a ""nice to have"" item, it's not something we'd purchase on our own.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review Program<br />Payment: Free"

It is very easy to use and wear, the sliding feature is outstanding like you would not believe it because it has an elegant design with it. I will also buy another to give it as a present to a friend. I also experienced the great customer service when I bought it. This is not just another slide belt with holes. The sliding is smooth and elegant and you can wear it with ease and without effort. If you are hesitant in buying this - do not bee because I assure you will not be disappointed with this belt.
11967	__label2__	3	N	Beauty	B00D4BF2B4	Perlier Honey Miel Nurturing Body Balm 6.7 Fl. Oz.	Does not smell like honey miel	I was really disappointed when I opened this and found that it does not have the scent of the honey miel soap. The scent is barely noticeable and kind of reminds me of dandelions. The lotion itself is good quality. It goes on nicely, is not greasy or sticky, and really does moisturize. I used to buy Perlier at department stores, but now I have to buy it online which means I cannot test any of the scents out.
12653	__label2__	5	Y	Home	B0085J6S0Y	Seville Classics Heavy-Duty 3-Bag Laundry Sorter Cart	Easier, breezier, sort, roll, wash	The only real tools one needs is one hands and goes together very nicely.  Ok, maybe the allen wrench, for the last two.  Still, I welcome the included tools.  There's no spare parts, so don't loose any.<br />It's definitely nicer to wheel around than my old pop up with 4 wheels.  I think if I'd gotten a massive laundry bag for the old pop up, that might have made do, but this is still easier to work with.<br />I definitely enjoy just popping the bag in with the laundry and knowing I'll have a clean bag to put the laundry in to take back.  Pre sorting, instead of all in one, does save time.  Seems like it and the bags will take some good years of abuse.  I'm glad the bags have replacements.  Even though you can cram a lot into one bag, it isn't too heavy to haul one bag by itself.<br />One day I had to leave a wet load in a bag overnight and it didn't drip., because of some laundry problems and had to leave, instead of wait for dryer.  That said the clothes while wet didn't come out of the washer dripping, so I'm sure if I poured a cup of water in the bottom, it'd probably drip through the canvas.  Things smelled like detergent, instead of mildew, when I got to rewash the next day.<br />This definitely takes up some space and unfortunately I don't know if it will make it to intended place in my closet, soon and doesn't look so nice hanging out in my bedroom.  I think I've already bent the bottom wire a little, by setting the detergent\softener on there and squeezing in a fourth hamper once, but I'm still glad it's there to support the bags and what not, compared to the competition.<br />It seems 3 categories isn't quite right for me, but the latter two are fewer and further between, so I guess linens\whites can share alternate and the whites can hang sit in one of those $1 meshes for now. Also, I might get an insert laundry bag, to separate my tops from delicates.  I can probably use the existing metal hanger, to make sure it doesn't fall down.<br />I guess the onlything I'm lacking is self cleaning wheels.  I guess I need to develop some kind of hallway wheel cleaning regimen, the hallways/elevator are nasty in other ways in addition to the odd puddle in the laundry room, before bringing back into the apt.
20724	__label2__	4	Y	Home Entertainment	B005GM6H8G	SuperSonic 13.3-Inch 1080p LED Widescreen HDTV HDMI AC/DC Compatible	Ably Fills the Need Without Taking Too Much Counter Space	Bought this as a replacement kitchen counter TV for my mother.  Her counter space is relatively small and this fit very nicely into the corner.  The picture is good and, if desired, you could enhance the sound with a bluetooth or other speakers.  But the sound is fairly decent for her purpose, that is, keeping an eye on what she has on the TV in the living room while she's making a meal, reheating coffee, etc.  However, the aging 9 inch Sony Trinitron on my kitchen counter -- which we used to say had a better picture than the long gone big Trinitron in the family room -- has become  unreliable with respect to color (blue portrayed as green, etc.).  So, I'm thinking of buying a second SuperSonic 13.3 inch for myself.  I have a large kitchen with a lot of counter space, but I am used to having only a small corner taken up by a television, and having seen how Mom's fits in limited space, I am definitely considering purchasing a second unit.

It burns my fats rapidly but not my  wallet.<br /><br />I am joining the company bike club this month (along with Fenfast) to speed up my weight loss.
4042	__label1__	1	N	Camera	B00OKRMKJI	DropCapsule Pro for Dropcam Pro. On sale for a limited time!	Heavily impaired night vision and unattractive design	Most importantly: the night vision does not work at all. The reflection from the IR is so massive that visibility is close to zero. See picture below. The capsule is also VERY heavy and not particularly nice too look at. As wall mount they suggest to use the original Dropcam wall mount, which is fine, but makes the camera somewhat prone to theft.

4130	__label1__	5	N	PC	B0054JGGGY	Razer Mamba Rechargable Wireless PC Gaming Mouse	Razar Mamba	Pros:<br />I love Razer packaging. I believe it is the start of the experience and design that shows they pay attention to detail.<br />This product is very easy to instal and setup. The wide variety of settings and possible programing make it ideal through several types of games and uses.<br /><br />Con:<br />While it is wireless, the wireless requires the included base. This is fine for desktop uses, but for a laptop it would have been nice to see Bluetooth like the Razer Orochi.<br /><br />Overall I love the Razer family of mice so far, and will be looking into their keyboards next.

14084	__label2__	4	N	Baby	B001BXYJZW	Healthy Baby: Asthma and Allergy Friendly Buddy Bear	Kind of A Heartbreaker	"This little guy is problematic.  I purchased him when my son was only a few months old while we were strolling through a very high end toy shop.  My son fell in love with him immediately and Buddy Bear has become his absolute FAVORITE companion aside of ""Octy"" from the Baby Einstein Ocean Adventure Gym.<br /><br />This bear does come apart at the seams of the ears and paws very easily, and needs to be sewn.  I had washed him inside a pillowcase on the gentle setting as the instructions explain.  After the first wash, before any use, the ear came undone, and I contacted the company for a replacement.  They required me to take a bunch of pictures, make a bunch of phone calls, and email them before they would send a replacement.  All over a $10 product. (Because moms of 4 month olds naturally have the time to do all of that)  In the end, they sent me a new Buddy Bear who is stashed away in case of an emergency.  The original guy has been sewn and re-sewn.  My little man loves this bear to pieces.  He is a trusted  companion for nap and bedtime.  This is an adorable, ridiculously cute bear for your little one, but it appears you may have to be handy with a needle and thread until the company makes some quality control improvements.  Overall, worth it when you see the love your little one will show Buddy Bear."

12167	__label2__	5	N	Books	B0006BTYPA	The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades	A marvelous spoof	This is a marvelous spoof book, written in very formal prose, about totally imaginary creatures. (I found a very nice copy at a garage sale selling for a dollar, 50 cents after a bit of bargaining).<br /><br />This was reprinted by The University of Chicago Press with the following legend: &#34;The Snouters was originally published in Germany, under the title Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia, by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart in 1957. Copyright � 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London.<br /><br />Maggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals.<br /><br />&#34;In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia – an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist.<br /><br />&#34;Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them – like the jackalope, for instance – exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald Stümpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it.<br /><br />&#34; Published under Stümpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from Stümpke/Steiner's book.&#34;<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book, and enjoyed reading both Maggie Koerth-Baker's description and the marvelous Reviews here on Amazon even more. My only problem is how to dispose of the book, now that I am down sizing my life.<br /><br />Robert C. Ross<br />March 2015

11393	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00E5UP64Q	Radio Flyer Ride and Stand Stroll 'N Trike	VERY high quality, durable, glides super smooth and actually pleasant to push!	This trike is very impressive.  I love how it can be used from 9 months all the way up to around 6 years old.  It's also great to use for two children because one can hold on to the back.  But what's really great about it is the quality. This thing glides over the floor so smoothly and is very, very solid in construction.  There is a lot of thoughtfulness in the way it was made, too.  You don't have to stoop over to push it, the handle in the back makes it super easy to push (even my 5 year old can do it) and turn, etc...<br /><br />Basically this is a kid's fun version of a double stroller... it has the capability to be turned into a tricycle but if you put all the pieces together at once it fits two children and the front one has shade and can pedal while you push.<br /><br />SUPER worth the money, after putting it together I would expect something like this to cost near to 200 dollars.  It should be a classic, because I honestly think it will last through a couple of generations. Highly recommend!

Seems built well and pretty stable. No loose parts or wiggles of the blade. This is not something I would carry in my pocket everyday. That's probably my fault for not looking at the dimensions before buying. The texture in the handle is like grip tape off a skate board. Don't really like that. Overall a decent knife for the price. Might try a smaller one.

I got this pool hoping to have something big enough for my kids to use and have fun in, but that's not what I got. First, it was extremely complicated to setup the whole system. Once I did get it set up and started filling it, I found that it had TWO leaks, not just one but TWO. I emptied the pool and attempted to fix them but it just didn't work. Overall I just wasn't happy and felt guilty for buying it.<br /><br />I dealt with that ordeal and then did some research to find a pool that my kids would enjoy and would show up in good condition. Luckily I found a great pool here on Amazon and have never been happier with it. I am glad my kids have something to enjoy this summer and I really can't find a single thing to complain about in over a month of them using it!<br /><br />If you want a quality pool, get the same one I did here on Amazon --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1p5nq0k<br /><br />I went ahead and got someone to set this one up for me since the other one was such a pain but it was totally worth it because my kids love it and it has no signs of a leak!
17204	__label2__	2	Y	Musical Instruments	B0002GXZK4	Jasmine S34C NEX Acoustic Guitar	Not impressed	This is a good guitar for beginners because it's something to start with and learn on. It's cheap which allows you to not spend alot of money on your first guitar only to lose interest or quit. But I do not recommend this guitar to any seasoned guitar player. It goes out of tune very quickly. Alothough it does produce a warm tone, I just can't handle the constant tuning.

11877	__label2__	2	Y	Kitchen	B007K98IEE	Sunbeam FPSBPMM980 4-Piece Pie Maker, Red	Filling Boiled Out of Blueberry Mini-Pies, Required Major Cleanup	"My husband loves home-made pies, so I thought it would be fun to make mini-pies from time to time, just to change things up a little.  After reading the Amazon reviews for various competing mini-pie makers, I ordered this well-reviewed SUNBEAM 4-PIECE PIE MAKER.  Little did I know what it had in store for me!<br /><br />I followed the booklet's recipe for blueberry mini-pies to the letter.  I lightly oiled the pie cups, preheated the pie maker, used the provided tool to cut top and bottom crusts from Pillsbury ready-made crusts, prepared the filling, used the provided tool to press the bottom crusts into the pie maker, measured 1/2 cup of filling into each bottom crust, added the top crusts, and clamped the top of the pie maker shut.<br /><br />The pie maker began emitting steam, which seemed odd.  After 10 minutes, the pie crusts were done.  However, the pie filling had boiled out onto the pie-maker plates, and a lot of it had spilled down the outside and into the hinges.  Because the pie-maker plates were hot, the filling was busily burning onto the plates.  As I was removing the mini-pies, the bottom of one burst and dropped all its filling.  The final straw was my husband's comment that his intact mini-pie seemed ""kind of filled with air""!<br /><br />Oh well.  Maybe I should have used one of the booklet's two recipes for pie crusts--although the booklet did say you could use ready-made crusts from the grocery store.  Or maybe I should have crimped the top and bottom crusts together--although the instructions did not say to do this, and the plates look like they will do the crimping when you close the lid.<br /><br />The cleanup was such a nightmare, I have no desire to ever use this appliance again.  The mini-pies are cute, but the preparation time is about the same as for a full-sized, double-crust blueberry pie (except that a 9"" pie needs 45 minutes to bake).  Also, the mini-pies don't hold much filling, especially if you have to use less than 1/2 cup of filling.  I rate this Sunbeam 4-piece pie maker at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale)."

10682	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B007WIAJY0	Equate - Stool Softener with Stimulant Laxative, 240 Tablets (Compare to Peri-Colace)	It works for pregnancy constipation	It works better than the other brands I have used before and much cheaper.<br />I had Peri Colace and Rite aid imitation, they make the stool very hard.<br />I'm surprised Wal-Mart brand actually works as a stool softerner and mild laxative.<br />My OB/GYN said Peri Colace is safe for pregnancy and I have long term<br />constipation since pregnancy started. It does help me to keep it going daily.<br />It pushes down the waste everyday in the morning and early afternoon.<br />The only side effect is the mild contraction it causes.<br />Sometimes feel gassy with an empty stomach.<br />Amazon has raised the price. But I'm almost done with the long ordeal of pregnancy.<br />Two packs could last 80 to 120 days.

The sleeve on the strap doesn't have a gripping surface, so it slides off my shoulder all the time. And the buckles aren't adjustable and I had to punch new holes so that the bag would close.
13263	__label2__	5	Y	Musical Instruments	B0073XCZ3C	Planet Waves NS Micro Tuner with Guitar Pick Sampler	Good tuner, inconspicuous and it works.	I've used this tuner for both my acoustic guitar and banjo for a year now and like them a lot.  We got this one for my wife's mandolin.  It's small, barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back.  I understand it can be a tight fit on some headstocks, it's snug on my 12 fret slot-head guitar due to the buttons pointing straight down but it works ok for me.  The accuracy is as good or better than any I've used.<br />Pros:<br />Accurate<br />Cheap<br />Easy to see in daylight or dark<br />Good battery life<br />It's always there, you don't have to hunt for a tuner.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me!

My body has reacted really well, meaning I just feel energetic and chipper all of the time. And of course I've lost weight, too, almost 30 pounds in just under 2 months. All in all, I love everything about these. Would definitely buy again.

He thought I would be excited to own this dvd, like I am with many other dvd movies. But I never felt crazy about this movie. I think Anthony Hall does a great job in a lot of the 80's movies, but this isn't one of them. He's done better acting.

11067	__label2__	4	N	Kitchen	B00KH9PWPC	New Star Foodservice 42849 Enameled Aluminum Lime Squeezer, Green	good basic lime juicer	An attractive lime squeezer. It fits normal-sized supermarket limes (cut in half), but might struggle with the extra-large persian limes available at peak season. It's too small to handle lemons.    This tool is not nearly as substantial as my Oxo Lemon/Lime squeezer. I prefer that larger Oxo squeezer for juicing many limes (necessary when the limes are dry, or for margaritas). The Oxo can also handle lemons easily.    In case you haven't used this kind of squeezer (previous to my Oxo, I used a reamer), it takes far less effort than reaming, and keeps the acidic juice off your skin.    The green color of this squeezer is a nice way to make it obvious what this tool is for, and the small size is a benefit for space-constrained kitchens. Recommended for lightweight lime juicing.
10919	__label2__	4	N	Wireless	B00604RZ12	Belkin Anti-Smudge Screen Protector for Apple iPod Touch 4th Generation (2 Pack)	Easy to Install and Does the Job	Overall, this cover does what it is supposed to do: it protects your iPod's screen and reduces the glare - in my case it helps stop a lot of the smudgy fingerprints.  This one was not too hard to line up and put on, either.<br /><br />Before you install it on your iPod, let me point out a couple of things:<br /><br />1. Clean your iPod's screen with the soft cloth that comes with the screen protector. DO NOT use water to assist you, but use a gentle wiping motion with the cloth. Why? You don't want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprints and have your fingerprints memorialized on your iPod!<br /><br />2. Make sure you use the straight-edge that comes with it, or a credit card, to help smooth out the bubbles.<br /><br />3. Be patient, line it up, and go slow! This cover doesn't have much wiggle-room to be slightly off - if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side, you will start covering the iPod's edge case vs. the screen. If that happens, slowly back it up and start again.<br /><br />Overall, this is not too bad and does what it is supposed to do, and I think you would rather have a screen protector vs. a scratched up iPod!

18765	__label2__	4	Y	Office Products	B000WMXX9Q	"Wooden Mail Organizer -Walnut Finish (Walnut) (17.5""H x 15""W x 9.75""D)"	Very Awesome Mail Organizer	I live in a house with 5 other housemates. For over a year I was constantly losing mail because we simply had one tray for everyone's mail. About six months ago I bought this and used a label maker to mark everyone's individual slot. This thing is a lifesaver.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) The piece itself is very sturdy and well put together. I know this is built to hold paper, so I know I don't have to worry about it falling apart on me.<br /><br />2) There are wooden pockets on both sides that can hold pens, blank envelopes, whatever else you need to put in it.<br /><br />3) There are plenty of hooks to put our keys. We have a mailbox that requires a key to open it and before we got this mailbox we were constantly losing the key for it. Now we are able to keep the mailbox key on a hook and it hasn't gotten lost once since I purchased this mail organizer.<br /><br />4) The very bottom slot is rather large and extends out past the other slots. It is PERFECT for large things that come in the mail (weekly grocery fliers, store magazines, food coupons, etc.).<br /><br />5) The slots can be made larger than what is pictured. The vertical pieces you are seeing that divide the trays into 8 mail slots can be removed. If you do not need all the slots show and desire a larger slot, that can be easily done.<br /><br />CONS<br />1) The slots are a lot smaller than I would have liked. I made the mistake of not checking the dimensions. The slots are not long enough to hold a normal size envelope. The envelope extends about 2 inches out past the end of the shelf. If you decide to label the slots, this makes it very hard to read or even see the labels.<br /><br />2) If a letter comes in the mail that isn't as long as a normal letter, but is taller than a normal letter, then the piece of mail has to be slightly folded in order to get inside the slot. Luckily (for me at least), those pieces of mail are usually junk mail and are not as important.<br /><br />3) The pieces that are used asdividers between slots are very flimsy. The piece as a whole is very well put together and sturdy, but these pieces are not as reliable. However, I have not had issues with any of them as of yet.
17901	__label2__	5	Y	Electronics	B003QHXZM4	Sangean CL-100 Table-Top Weather Hazard Alert with AM/FM-RBDS Alarm Clock Radio	Remarkably Good Sangean CL-100 Weather Radio	&#34;SAME&#34; county code entry helps to limit alerts to only those events and localities that could actually pose a hazard, and it actually works very well!  If you've been dissatisfied with the poor performance or unwanted alerts from older, poorer-quality weather radios, you will find this Sangean CL-100 a welcome improvement.  The FM reception is excellent, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small radio; not &#34;room-filling&#34; but still very listenable for music, and clear for voice.  AM reception llacks sensitivity and has noticeable 60 hz hum on much of the band, but in many areas, there is little to listen to on AM.  It's hard to imagine a compact AM/FM/Weather Radio that would be any better.

I ordered two of these for a bunk bed that I purchased online and went solely off the reviews of others and it seemed good so I bought it and it came rolled up just like others have said and when you cut the packaging open it unfolds and inflates itself which is pretty cool for the kids to see.  We laid on it right away to try it out and it was very very comfortable and after letting it sit overnight it is still very comfortable.  My wife thought it would be bad or risky to buy online without trying a mattress first but it's for the kids and they obviously don't have a preference in beds and the reviews were good so we took a chance and it's great!<br />It's also reversible so you can use either side that you wish.  It's a good deal with the prime shipping so I would definitely recommend this mattress.

For what I paid for this carrier, Yakima could have included a more secure cable lock. I added more security for my Trek with a Kryptonite u-lock and a thicker cable.

We came home an hour later and found her out, and when we investigated the crate we realized she must have put pressure on the zipper and unzipped it.  We took a luggage lock and locked the two zippers together, and went out for another short trip.  We came home and found her out again, only this time she pushed hard enough against the door to rip the zipper out at the seam.<br /><br />We returned the damaged crate (Amazon refunded us) and went with a sturdier plastic crate with metal bar door.  I loved the looks of this and I'm sad it didn't work!  I think any dog, no matter what size, is going to look at this crate as a challenge and work to get out of it.

I have noticed a little bunching, getting a little slouchy around the ankles, but I think that may be because of my larger than average calves and regular ankles. BY the way, the normal size fits my muscular calves quite well. I wear a size 10 and size 10 fits perfectly. Would definitely buy Dr. Scholl's boots again.

I love Oakland A's & SF Giants Bruce Bochy. I want more movies about great managers like Bruce Bochy & Billy Bean.

11039	__label2__	5	N	Books	0373893051	The Delight Gluten-Free Cookbook: 150 Delicious Recipes	Here's the recipes I tested and info on the special features in this cookbook. It's now a must-have for my gluten-free cooking!	"With 2 members of the family who are gluten-free,  I'm always searching for new and innovative recipes. Whether you're experienced or are new to gluten-free cooking, this book would be among my top 3 choices - not only for the recipes ( you can check out the ones I tested and the results below) but some unique special features. There are instructions on how to prepare several special flour mixes.. There is also comprehensive information about many  other aspects of gluten-free living. This is an impressive resource.    A major asset of this book are the instructions for creating  3 special baking flour blends, each with special advantages. There is the Basic Gluten-Free All-Purpose Homemade Flour Blend. Then there is  a High- Protein and Fiber All Purpose flour blend as well as another option-  a High-Protein, Low -Glycemic Flour blend.     These special mixes do NOT appear on any store shelves and are only in this book.    Listed below are the results of a round of testing recipes and the results.  Below that is a section on the special features of this book. The author is an active member of the advisory board of the Celiac Disease Program at Children's National Medical Center as well as the executive editor of Delight Gluten-Free magazine.    I do think it is important to note that if you are following a low-calorie or low-fat diet, you will need to keep a CLOSE eye on the calorie and fat counts per serving. Many are high. Even so, I found that by making a few simple substitutions . I could  lower calories and fat to acceptable levels. However, the recipes I tested for this review have NOT been altered or tweaked from the original instructions.     Also, there are a fair number of recipes here that are reasonably low in calories. These include: Veggie Pizza, Crab and Oyster Mushroom Bisque, Gazpacho salad, Spiced Kale Chips, Stuffed Mushrooms (Lemon, Ricotta and Kale filling)    On to the recipes:    Here's what we made on Day 1: We started with Herbed Hummus, anice mixture of garbanzo beans, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, basil leaves, cilantro leaves, parsley, chives, and garlic. It was incredible, eaten on its own or served with gluten-free crackers. This is a recipe which is easily tweaked a bit so if you hate cilantro, as some do, add a bit more parsley or adjust to taste. We followed the recipe just as written. We devoured it within an hour.     Next on the agenda? Another appetizer, Baked Potato Chips with Parsley, Garlic and Sea Salt. This is an easy snack recipe to prepare and clean-up is minimal, especially if you have parchment paper on hand to line the baking sheets (as recommended by the author) These chips could also be a side dish with dinner. They had a nice depth of flavors, and the simple additions of garlic and parsley were just the right touches. You can modify this one easily to accommodate your favorite spices.     Moving on to dinner: we made Green Beans with Tomatoes, Garlic, and Onions. We had fresh green beans and tomatoes waiting to be used. It took less than 15 minutes to pull this one together (not counting time to remove the ends from the fresh green beans) . Fresh green beans, onions, garlic and a touch of red pepper flakes. Delish!    Then came Pan- Seared Chicken Cutlets with Mushroom Gravy. Took minutes to make and the gravy turned simple  chicken cutlets into a gourmet dish.    We wanted a simple dessert for the meal's finish so we went with the Flan de Coco, easily made with staple ingredients found in our refrigerator and pantry. Very satisfying.     We didn't have time to cook many breads except for quick breads. The Peach Yogurt Quick Bread was a smash hit - as were the Oatmeal Pancakes and the Buttermilk Cheddar Breakfast Biscuits. I'm particularly interested in seeing how the sandwich bread turns out and will update this review then. To be honest, by the time we got to breads  I was feeling too tired to tackle more.    Special features of this cookbook: In addition to the standardinfo about foods which contain gluten, there is an extensive list of gluten-free ingredients, safe food additives, unsafe foods,etc. The info on Food Labeling Laws in the United States was helpful for me as well as special tips on ""Navigating the Grocery Store for Home Cooking"" ."

I'm very impressed with these. I have been looking at various collapsible poles now for about 18 months, and always figured I'd pony up and buy a set of Black Diamonds. A few months back, I started knocking out 14ers in Colorado this year, with the goal to get 10 in about 6 weeks. I have used about 4 others sets of trekking poles in my hiking life and was never particularly sold on any of them. Obviously when a hike become a difficult class 2 or class 3 scramble, fixed poles become a PITA, and I usually end up strapping them to my chest or bag. I also like to be able to adjust my poles (shorter up mountain, longer down) since I have a bad knee. This set was the first &#34;hybrid&#34; (adjustable, collapsible) pole I stumbled across on Amazon, and I figured for the price it would probably be cheaply made or heavy. Surprisingly they were slightly lighter (an ounce each) than my other 3 sets, and the ergonomics of the handle surprised me as well. I have put about 40 miles and 4 peaks on them so far including Colorado's highest peak, and the second highest in the continental US, and I was impressed enough to come back to order another pair.

It's certainly worth the money but it has a few frustrating issues. As others said, the light is not as bright as it could be although it's adequate. The mechanism by which you situate the light for reading is a little slapdash but it works. Worst thing is the snap on the back which holds the light when you're not using it. With this in place, you can not place the Kindle down flat for daytime reading.<br /><br />Would buy again but could be better!

I was a bit reluctant to purchase this mouse for 2 reasons: (1) my experience with braided cables is that they eventually tangle into series of knotted masses and (2) the mouse buttons have a reported tendancy to stick down, becoming stuck in an active position. After months of heavy use, I can gladly report that neither of these things have yet to happen.<br /><br />In terms of feel, I really like the textured surface because it allows for greater friction against the surface of the palm and it generally looks nice as a matt black fininsh. I also like the feel of the mouse scroller; the smoothness of the scroller in action accompanied by the calming blue lights is all quite lovely.

My husband and I have been needing a new mattress for some time and I found this one online with great reviews. I was a little hesitant to purchase a mattress without seeing it first, but I have no regrets. We did not have any issues with 'new mattress smell' that some noted in their reviews and were sleeping on it the first night we received it (It did take a couple of days to fully spring back to it's normal shape after shipping). It was a little firmer than I was expecting, but we quickly became used to it, and now I consistently sleep much more deeply than I have in years. My husband, who has scoliosis, is equally impressed and also sleeping much better. We definitely recommend this one!

Drink a lot of water and try maybe 30 minutes before instead of the recommended 2 hours. Because cmon it's kinda hard to predict when you'll have a chance to eat especially if you have a busy day. What I do is whenever im feelin a little hungry I just go ahead and take the pill and then I distract myself for about half an hour and then boom chow down. Using this got me a motivated to go to the gym too just to try and further receive some results, but trust me im not doing anything too exhausting there. So for me personally, dropping soda and drinking water, Im working towards my goal. Hopefully this helps.

As usual, I was excited to use this router in my three story house and get a full signal at all times. Although, that couldn't be further from what happened... This thing dropped signal so often, I couldn't get anything done!<br /><br />This was so hard for me, after spending so much money and to be worse off than I was before.<br /><br />After I dealt with returning this router and researching as much as possible I found a GREAT router that hasn't given me a single issue in any way.<br /><br />If you want to take a look, it is here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/1hQmOP7<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the router for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one.

He hated it so much that even when we used to date he would avoid coming over but that's changed thanks to this lightweight and easy to use tool. The comb doesn't catch or tug so my little Pepper likes it and thanks to it my husband he can appreciate Pepper's cute and loveable attitude instead of his coat.

I use one clamp in each set and align everything and then I screw all the holes in and remove the clamps and place the scews in those holes and boom, done.  Keeps everything perfectly aligned.

11913	__label2__	5	N	Pet Products	B00BRNGUDK	Zylafen for Reptiles (1.25 oz)	Does what it says - money saver!	I bought this for a beardy who had a damgaed sinus cavity from being bit by a litter mate when she was tiny.  She gets a yellow drip from her eye and nose which causes a raw spot on her lip and bacteria problems on the skin of the whole side of her face and beard. She also has thick dead skin that just won't shed independently without this medicated skin thereapy. She HATES the taste of it (as did the pet in the previous review), which causes her to not be cooperative for the treatments. You HAVE to keep up with the treatments daily until the condition clears; if you don't follow the directions it obviously won't work. Be liberal with the coverage or dosing, and DO keep the animals away from water and sand or walnut bedding as it will stick to the syrup like treatment or wash off. It does not affect breeding animals as she had two clutches totalling 53 eggs during daily dreatments. Her's is a lifelong problem.<br />If it wasn't for this medication, I know a specialty veterinarian would have charged me $$$ to get my beardy Huevos back to health. Give this product a try for the recommended symptoms in the description - it is worth the money. It has a tip that is a drop dispenser making applications on small spots easy. Watch that your pet doesn't clamp down on the tip for mouth treatments because they can remove the hard dropper end and get it their mouth along with a glob of medine. Huevos did this, and she did not get sick...just surprised that she made her situation worse.<br />Hope this review helps some sick pets get well.

When it died suddenly	When it worked for the first six months it was fine.<br /><br />When it died suddenly, I contacted Mediasonic about the problem. Since it was less than a year old, I was told that it was still under warranty and they would send a replacement upon receipt of the tracking number for my package to them with the defective unit. I followed these instructions and sent them an email on 12/2 with the tracking number. On 12/5 I contacted them and asked if the replacement had shipped. Yes! It had, except that it shipped on 12/5, when they received the defective unit, not when I sent in the original tracking number. To compound this delay problem, they sent the replacement unit via Fed Ex Ground (slower than the Pony Express) and it is now predicted to be thrown at my door on 12/15, a full 10 days since it was mailed and almost two weeks since it should have been sent to me. I emailed Mediasonic about this and how frustrated I was and just received an emailed apology. For the price point, it is not worth this hassle dealing with the company for warranty issues.

They block sun well enough for all-day riding.  As a reminder, these are not magic.  The cooling effect is:<br />A) Reflection of sunlight.  If you're not wearing white ones, they will absorb sunlight and get hot.<br />B) Evaporative cooling.  If you are not sweating, and there is no airflow, then you will feel warm.<br /><br />I'm 197cm (6'5&#34;) tall.  My biceps are 13.5&#34; and my forearms are 12&#34; in circumference.  From armpit to wrist on the inside is 25&#34;.  I find that these sleeves end up settling to about 16.5 inches long on my arms.  That leaves about 1/2 inch between my longest cycling jersey and these; plus there is a gap of 2-3 inches from my glove line to these.  I can stretch to cover more, but that's what they retract to over time.<br /><br />They are like thin, stretchy socks, so if you have an agitator post in your washer, these could get hung up.  I usually just put a little dish soap on them and do a quick scrub in the kitchen sink every 2-3 rides, and make sure they are laid out to dry in the heat after a ride.  That being said, I've had no problems running them through the laundry.

10660	__label2__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B00DZW1CDO	Ernie Ball MVP, Most Valuable Pedal	Very Well Made / More Expressive Options Than a Fixed Sweep Pedal	There are a number of models in Ernie Ball’s pedal series with different features and Amazon will often combine reviews, which (IMO) can be confusing.  To be clear, I’m talking about the MVP 6162 – the straight mono volume pedal plus a tuner jack. There’s no stereo pan functionality and, although the instruction sheet doesn’t specify, based on performance it’s a good bet the pedal uses a 250k audio-taper pot similar to the 6166 and 6180 models – best suited for passive guitar and bass pickups.  I don't usually comment on other reviews but incorrect info shouldn't go unchallenged when it can mislead people. Anyone who says this pedal won't fully cut off volume is wrong or isn’t using it correctly: There are minimum and maximum sweep knobs and turning the minimum knob fully counter-clockwise gives you a heel position that fully cuts off volume (or as fully as turning down the volume pot on your instrument will – I’m not talking scientific detection of incidental line noise/interference here - just practical 'off').  The minimum knob also allows you to set the lower volume ‘floor’ – meaning if you don’t want to fully cut off volume you can maintain some level at the pedal’s full-heel position.  Why might you want to do this? Consistency for one: In a dynamic playing context, you may not have time to tweak the pedal position just so. Quickly going full-heel, confident you’re at the level you want,  can be a real convenience (and your sound person/recording engineer will thank you – even if it’s yourself).  At the other end the maximum knob is somewhat more intuitive:  it allows you to set the toe-full-down maximum volume. By experimenting with min and max settings you can vary the sweep from heel to toe along with the absolute floor and ceiling volume. If you’ve only used a volume pedal with a single fixed sweep – and you wished for either a ‘tighter’ or more-gradual swell, the MVP will provide some useful and possibly more expressive and comfortable options.  In case you’re wondering, turning both the max and min knobs fully down does not give you an ‘anti-volume’ pedal with zero sound, it sets a fairly wide sweep from full off to a relatively low-level maximum.  I got the MVP to replace my trusty-but-scratchy 40+ year-old DeArmond pedal I've had since I discovered as a kid in the 70's that Steve Howe used one. I'm a lefty and lefty instruments were rare and pricey so I converted my own guitars, leaving the knobs on the right-hand side. Because of that I could never manage that Roy Buchanan pinky-twist move with the volume pot and needed a pedal to get 'violin' tones and textures (the EBow was still a couple of years away).  Speaking of comfort, the MVP toe-down position lies parallel to the floor while the DeArmond has a 15-20 degree angle that I always found easy on my ankle – especially if I’m doing a lot of fast movements. It wouldn’t be hard to devise a large wooden shim for the MVP if you feel the same way.  The MVP pedal action is much tighter compared to the DeArmond and I prefer  that because it makes fine control easier (no doubt decades of use have loosened up the DeArmond but even in its prime I remember wishing it were a little stiffer). One thing the DeArmond has that the MVP doesn’t is a side-to-side tone pot function – granted it’s cheesy and will cost you even more in tone than the volume pot itself does, but it’s there. Speaking of impact on pure signal, I couldn’t detect much loss with the MVP – although as always, the longer your cables the more potential degradation.  The MVP’s 3/16” brushed aluminum casing is rugged, has nice mass to sit tight without being excessively heavy, and looks great. The flat, rubberized foot surface has nice ‘tooth’ to it that’s comfortable to use wearing shoes or not.  The min/max knobs are heavy metal (no pun intended) and have solid turn ratios.  I wish the battery door were metal rather than plastic but I like that it’s hinged otherwise it would just scream ‘lose me!’. The battery sits close to the surface and is easy to fish in and out. The review pedal didn’t come with a power supply but I prefer batteries when recording - power supplies can add noise especially at low levels.  If I were back in my club-gig days, tossing equipment in and out of dark trunks, I might question the open access to the pedal’s internal components under the foot control – too easy to get picks and other small items stuck in there and it could be a pain to shake them out.  I can’t comment on the tuner jack function (I’m old school tuning fork and ears).  Bottom Line: The MVP makes for a more flexible-functioning and quieter volume pedal than traditional fixed sweep pedals.  And in this age of ever-thinner plastics the top-notch workmanship is much appreciated.  I’ll still keep my DeArmond for sentimental reasons but the MVP will surely be my go-to volume pedal from now on.

11194	__label2__	4	Y	Sports	B004IZ9KV8	Golf Gifts & Gallery Clubhouse Collection Electric Putting Cup	Saves time and functions well	I have a 7 year old daughter that is a competetive junior golfer.  She practices putting everyday at home and goes to the course 2x a week.  I have a large indoor putting green and just walking to the other end to gather balls is just too slow and tends to lengthen her training time.  So we decided to try this.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1.  Portable - This is very small and can be moved around as long as you have an outlet.<br />2.  Ball return - You can adjust the ball return speed.  So if you are practicing short putts adjust the speed slower so that the ball does not come back at you too fast.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.  Moves - This does not have the weight and does not stay in place very well.  After a few putts, you will have to reposition it again since it moves.  I placed a 1 pound dumbbell on top of it so that it does not move.  It worked.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Aside from having to use weights to keep it in place, it has actually been a very useful tool.  She can hit more putts during her 1 hour practice session which will help her be a better golfer.

I use their lighting, backdrop frames and have a few of their muslin backdrops including a green screen all of which are excellent products.<br /><br />This particular backdrop was unfortunately a huge disappointment. I know enough to at least<br />understand that a really good, thick top quality muslin background, be it painted or not can set you back upwards of 300 clams.<br /><br />So I try to keep my expectations reasonable when ordering a background at this price point. However, I feel at any price this particular background will disappoint.<br /><br />* Uneven color and terrible dye bleeds cause shadows<br /><br />* The single most wrinkled background I've ever seen. Expect to spend a good hour steaming them out.<br /><br />* Poor quality stitching, means easy rips and tears<br /><br />* Extremely thin Muslin means a myriad of problems with lighting<br /><br />In my opinion this is a terrible choice, especially for the novice or intermediate, I consider myself in the latter category. That said, if you're looking for a decent background with color, and at this price point  there are plenty to choose from.<br /><br />Cowboy Studio has many fine products however this particular background isn't one of them.

While the basics remain the same, the story has layers that are peeled off as the story continues to unfold until we at last learn the shocking truth.<br /><br />After the last episode ended with an argument between the Doctor and Leela, this story quickly diffuses the situation in a way that felt a little bit too easy. Still, as Leela says, the Doctor had gone days without talking to her which had led her to read more and what she'd read were fairy tales. Leela's pointing out similaritites to Fairy Tale moments. This device works very well throughout the story, creating a little bit of a sense of rythym, being used for occasional comic relief, and in one case actually adding to the terror of the moment (when Leela's reminded of Little Red Riding Hood meeting the wolf disguised as her grandma.<br /><br />It's a wonderfully atmospheric and clever tale featuring great acting and a superb soundscape.

3097	__label1__	1	N	Office Products	B000K5WIVO	HP 92 (C9512FN) Black Original Ink Cartridges, 2 pack	I hate this crap!	Ink is such a ripoff, but especially this kind. I hate HP ink! And let me tell you WHY! Because the crap hardly lasts and it's a complete ripoff. ALL of these people that wrote these five star reviews must either work for HP or SMOKE CRACK IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS. No one in their right mind would say they enjoy paying $20 OR MORE for something that probably costs less than $.50 to make (probably more like $.10 even after handling costs) and that can't even print out a short novel, or heck, a children's story for that matter.<br /><br />To the reviewer that said this black ink cartridge lasts 220 pages YOU ARE A FLAT-OUT LIAR AND/OR A MORON, and neither should be writing reviews and giving untruthful info to other people. The only way this ink would last 220 pages is if each page had a single word printed on it or maybe a single sentence. Maybe even a short paragraph. But no way in hell would one of these cartridges last 220 full pages. NO WAY, NO WAY, NO F-ING WAY. I do my own personal taxes, the taxes for my parents, and taxes for my own business. I print two copies of every return, one for my records and one for sending in (I don't e-file). I printed 38 pages this year, 2014. Let me spell that out for you: T-H-I-R-T-Y E-I-G-H-T P-A-G-E-S...And that's it! The ink is GONE. R-I-P-O-F-F<br /><br />I don't know what the solution is for this BS printer and ink problem we have right now, but I know it's NOT buying these HP cartridges because they suck!
6749	__label1__	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00QHLSKOE	Matricom G-Box Q² Android TV Streaming Media Mini PC [2GB/16GB/4K] Quad/Octo Core	My favorite streamer	I own Roku 3 and Apple TV, Nexus player from Google and the Amazon fire box. For what Im looking for the Q is the only box that does the job the right way without hassles. I have had nothing but problems with the apple Tv from having the jailbreak this thing every month I just gave up on that. XBMC runs flawlessly on the Q and I havent had to do a thing to it. Just run and it works and I mean everything works. All the content I add to XBMC on here plays perfectly. Even the apple TV jailbroken wouldn't play some of my collection. The Nexus is closest but has problems with some MKV formats in XBMC. The Q is by far the most compatible device I have used for throwing any kinda media at and never flinches. It just works. High regards from me for this box and highly recommend for anybody that doesn't want to worry about if their media is going to be compatible or not with the box they own.

We HIGHLY recommend looking, and even getting http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00NFETB9Y  We had a wind up mobile before purchasing this one and hated it. THIS one http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B005F21DA4  This mobile is wonderful. I think the baby especially likes the projection. The first time we turned it on, our 2 month old smiled and smiled. The remote control is handy and I love that it plays for 20 minutes.   I don't know how long the batteries will last, but it is so much better than the wind up kind I don't care. It was easy to install on the crib and is very secure. I wish there were more volume settings (it has two). Even on the loudest setting it is kinda quiet. I would definitely purchase this mobile again or buy it for other future mothers for a shower gift.  We just put batteries in it last night, and I am in love with it!! So here it is from baby's eye view. :)  The only downside: the tiny screwdrivers that are needed for assembly. I had to search through my husbands computer kit to find one that was small enough.  In short, get the http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00NFETB9Y  I hope this review was helpful!

This is why they slide around sometimes. Also, they don't have the factory look, but this can be noticed only when you take a closer and careful look.<br />But, the material from which they are made is a quality one.

Then I learned better and for years I've been very careful about what I say or do online. This book has reinforced that.<br /><br />This is a textbook, or at least it's written like one, but it's well written and very informative and if you even just leaf through it without reading it, you'll come away with attitude that it's better to keep your attitude at home when you go online.<br /><br />The above being said, this book is a must have for anybody going into the legal profession today, because so much of our lives are spent online. Chances are if you wind up representing someone in court, digital evidence will come up and digital evidence experts may be involved. An attorney needs to know about these things, more so every day.
17879	__label2__	5	N	Outdoors	B007E0ZBZI	Cascade Mountain Tech Carbon Fiber Trekking Poles	Great poles, great price.	I bought these poles from Costco for under $30, not knowing anything about them.  My physical therapist told me to give up running (for my back) and suggested I try walking with poles.  I use them for exercise/walking, not backpacking.  Now that I have gotten used to them, they feel just like a pair of good cross-country ski poles.  They give my arms, shoulders, and upper body an excellent work out while walking.  I typically do 3-4 miles on pavement and come back with a shirt completely soaked with sweat.  If I walk on an unpaved trail, I use the metal tips and no shock-absorber - on pavement I use the rubber rocker-shaped tips and use the shock absorbing feature.  The pavement does wear out the rubber tips fairly quickly, but Amazon sells replacements for $5.85 a pair.  These poles are definitely worth more than $30.

They are comfortable to wear and don't leave lines when you put your pants skirts or whatever you are wearing over top

I have already started to use this DVD with my kids and little cousins. Growing up basketball kept me active during the summer, in shape, and out of trouble.

The material is very soft and the print looks good. To remedy the problem we placed a 10x20 black backdrop behind this one and it looked as if my wife was pretty far in front of the wall and it made a corner into a darker room. Raising it up high enough for a standing person brought the floor up higher but due to the prop behind my wife it did make it look as if the wall was further back.

Only taking 2 bottles of FertilAid plus 2 bottles of Sperm count boost and 2 bottles of Motility Boost, my wife was tested pregnant positive last week.  These supplements were the only difference in my daily diet. I am still taking them because I also feel more energetic during work. Highly recommend to everyone!

I have no problem on the larger planes with the seat belts but I need an extension on the smaller planes.

I've seen the Numark many a times in the store and online. Based on reviews from this site and others I didn't believe other consumer's experience until I had an opportunity to play and create a mix. Finally, last month I was able to mess around with the Numark Mixdeck.It's just WOW! I had 2 USB flashdrives, installed my mp3s on unit. It was easy to go through tracks as if physically I thumb through LPs. Every Mp3 was alphabetized when I searched for track to cue from deck to another deck. Anyone that knows how to beatmatch can easily pick up on a mix once getting to familiarize the units keys and features.

I take it for walks with the dog so I don't have to pick up dog poo through a plastic bag.  Not a fan of touching it, even if there's a bag between me and the poop.  That said, my wife does not love it.  She thinks it is too big/long to carry around.  The smaller size one is probably good enough, but this is good if you have a lab or large dog.  We have a lab and if she goes #2 multiple times on a walk, I'm glad I have this one and not a smaller one.<br /><br />Very well built, have owned for a few years now and is is showing no signs of wear.  I also use this to pick up our yard.  I like it a lot and would recommend.

3032	__label1__	4	Y	Automotive	B001EOYIRW	CURT 13354 Class III Receiver	Frustrating installation until we used a 14mm tap with a thread pitch of 1.5	"If you are reading this review prior to buying and installing the product, do this RIGHT NOW - buy a 14 mm tap with a thread pitch of 1.5. My husband has worked on all of our cars for years. He is also a mechanical engineer. When we read all the reviews about it being a tight fit, we thought those people were being dodo birds.<br /><br />We put our 2009 Acura MDX up on car ramps and my husband struggled for two hours on a Friday night before giving up. There is too much build up to install this hitch without thoroughly cleaning all the gunk off and using the tap in the bolt holes under the vehicle. We thought we would get a tap on Saturday and get it installed. ""How hard would it be to find a 14 mm tap? We live in the Seattle are so it shouldn't be a problem,"" we thought. Oh. How. Wrong. We. Were. Places like Ace Hardware and Shucks Auto do not carry a tap that large in-store. They were special orders only. After calling a few friends out of desperation, we were referred to Tacoma Screw in Seattle and they had one. Machine shops are not open in the weekends, so that's why we had trouble getting one. It took five hours to track one down.<br /><br />Once my husband used the tap on all the holes, the hitch went right on. It was still a snug fit, but he didn't have to struggle.<br /><br />We have been using the hitch for about a month now. It looks good on the car and didn't require a special bumper trim piece. We are happy with the hitch itself and have used it to attach our Yakima Holdup bike rack.<br /><br />I also recommend buying the hitch cap if ordering the hitch from Amazon. It was under four bucks and gives the hitch a more polished look when not in use.<br /><br />The hitch arrived from Amazon on a Friday instead of Monday as Amazon estimated a three days sooner than expected. It was packaged in the original Curt box. It was supported nicely in the cardboard box and the hitch was wrapped to prevent scratches. The hitch was in pristine condition.<br /><br />This hitch would have gotten 5 stars, but I feel like there should be a recommendation from the manufacturer to have the tap on hand when you start, thus only 4 stars."

This is my first iPad (Mini), my first iPad cover, and my first Amazon purchase. After purchasing I feel I navigating the reviews, products and prices quite well. I like the stand modes. My solitary complaint is the lack of a good way to prop it for typing. I like 5-10 degree angle, this one is about 15 degrees so I just lay it on deck of cards or something similar. The automatic power down is really nice and used constantly. The whole cover feels sturdy and protective of my precious machine inside. This is why I give it full score.

The material is that of a sports visor, but when it's worn, it looks like a much dressier hat. (I bought this visor in black.) It would be easy to wear this visor outdoors, as well as the theatre. It looks so good that I plan to get another. I've since bought this visor in navy and in olive. The olive color is more of an olive-gray, so it can easily be worn with outfits that one would not ordinarily wear with olive. Very versatile visor--I've worn it on windy days (it actually stays on better than my other visors), gardening and walking the dog.

They seemed a little more comfortable to me in socks but they are wearable either way. It was so nice to be able to simply unstrap the strap to take them off; no sitting down to untie shoelaces, no having to rip them off your feet.
16539	__label2__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B003V8BE6C	Pearl KGT100H GyroTune Key with Quick-release Neck strap	VERY well tought-out design!	At first, I thought $20 for a drum key looked ridiculous.  But, this thing is REALLY handy.  The oversimplified product description doesn't do it justice.  First of all, the outer &#34;wings&#34; are weighted (more on this in a minute) and very comfy in both directions - a nice feature when cranking a head down tight to seat it.  Second, when you remove the lanyard to use it, there is a knurled knob-like part that sticks up above the key.  Once tension rods are loose (either during removal or installation), you can give it a spin between your fingers and make fast work of the rod (the weighted wings give it a little inertia to keep it spinning).  Third, the little colored rubber nubs (supplied) are handy in TWO ways: a) by using different colors it can assist in keeping track of revolutions, and b) they're perfect for tapping near the edge for lug tuning.  The lanyard is an added bonus for keeping track of the key, either around your neck or hanging off one of the floor tom tension rods.  I'd recommend it, and may even buy a second one for my practice kit.
20921	__label2__	2	Y	Shoes	B008HE0YG6	Clarks Women's Lexi Myrtle Sandal,White,6 W US	Wide shoes for large people not simply wide feet	I am always looking for wide shoes that are comfortable. I happen to be of average or even less than average weight and have wide feet. These are really cute shoes and could be very comfortable, but not for me.<br /><br />These shoes are designed for people who need wide shoes for a reason other than bone structure. The toe box fit my feet well, but there was so much room for the rest of my foot, that my foot rubbed and I ended up with four blisters. I was very disappointed. But it helped me understand why when I entered a Clarks store one time and asked for wide shoes, the clerk asked me, &#34;Why do you think you need wide shoes?&#34; I'm guessing that that is how they make their wide shoes- wide overall.<br /><br />If you are a large person though, you will be thrilled! Great cushion in the sole, cute style, cool for summer!

My daughter has been obsessed with collecting all of the Swarovski ornaments since I can remember and now that she's off on her own I wanted to get this year's for her tree. I haven't given it to her but I did open it up and make sure everything was looking good: I'll do my custom wrap before giving it to her soon. I've seen a lot of these ornaments in action in the past and they really shine and sparkle like you've never seen. In my opinion the price is kind of steep but I realize that there's a lot of workmanship that goes into each and every one. I know she'll love it!

8970	__label1__	5	N	Video DVD	B006QR2842	Cohen, Leonard - The Complete Review	Superb	This is a lovingly researched and professionally edited 2 DVD set giving the ultimate overview of the life and career of the great Leonard Cohen. Unlike many of these type programs this one DOES have plenty of LC's music and performance footage, and even some LC interviews (albeit archive ones)  If you aren't ever going to get around to reading one of the breeze-block sized biographies (none of which, as far as I'm aware are sanctioned or have any contribution from Leonard himself) then this will do the job nicely. And if you have read everything, time to get a little less academic less and chill out in front of the this very decent 3.5 hour documentary.
11118	__label2__	3	Y	Pet Products	B000VKA92I	Liquid Health K-9 Glucosamine, Hip and Joint Formula, 32 Ounce (Packaging may vary)	Not good for us...	I think this worked with the painful walking, but it gave my little doggy diarrhea, so I've quit using it.  As soon as I stopped using it for the dog his diarrhea stopped.  That's why I gave it three stars instead of four or five.  I've also got &#34;Betta Bridges Pets Dog Glucosamine+MSM+Chrondroitin+Joint & Hip Support,&#34; from Amazon that works very well and has a measured dispenser.  I've been using that instead, and it is working well without the diarrhea.

You could probably read through the whole thing in an hour, but it's ideal for just picking up and flipping to any given entry. Most of the wikipedia entries are funny enough on their own but the comments at the end are great as well. Highlights include Frankenberry, which I will never look at the same way again after learning of ""Frankenberry Stool"", Codpieces in Star Wars and the Wing Bowl. Highly recommended."
6815	__label1__	5	N	Lawn and Garden	B00O97CPIK	Rid Tech Ultrasonic Pest Repeller - Repels Rodents and Insects	for $16 it's a steal	My family had spent hundreds of  $$$ on pest control over the course of one year, when we didn't have babies in the house yet it was okay to use chemicals although it still poses health risks to adults.<br /><br />But we usually schedule fumigation and chemical pest control work around trips. However, it doesn't take that long for insects to return so we had to do it regularly.<br />When my niece was born 4 months ago, we decided not to have chemicals sprayed in our home anymore and we switched to only environmental friendly products.<br /><br />This one is a steal for $16, it's safe and non-toxic and it works so well.

If you love Hogwarts, and don't mind your shirts being pretty fitted, you should get this shirt. It was surprisingly flattering for being so fitted, although if you have about a C cup or larger the first and last letters of the word &#34;Hogwarts&#34; curve under and are a little harder to read, but it is still super cute. Some friends and I bought matching ones to wear on a trip to Universal Studios and we were very comfortable and cute the whole day.

I have filled these with hand cream for our long cold winter - perfect for an occupation that requires constant hand-washing and hand-sanitizing.<br /><br />Each little GoTubb holds plenty of hand cream for 2-3 weeks, and though each rattles around at the bottom of my small purse/large purse/knitting and book tote, the cover hasn't popped off. The design is really impressive - keeps the product fresh, the lid is very easy to open (but doesn't come off in your bag or pocket), and doesn't seem to gather bag-lint.<br /><br />Combine a set of these with a favorite hand cream, and you have a perfect gift!

Usually as we dig through trying to find something to wear our bag becomes a mess of unfolded clothes. This will allow us to get to exactly what we need or want without making a huge mess. I also love the colors. If I get a new set in another color I can color code it as his and hers.

While looking for helpful camping tools for an upcoming girls trip, I came across the Fire Lighter Spider. I bought it on whim but was skeptical since like I said  before, this is not my forte. I tried this on my patio first to make sure even I could make it work, and it is amazing. It is almost impossible not to get a good campfire going with the spider. I highly recommend this tool to anyone from novice campers to serious backpackers alike. This is time saving and easy, even in the dark!

10990	__label2__	4	N	Camera	B00AQDG99M	Sony DSC-W730 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver) (OLD MODEL)	Very portable, but photo quality is so-so.	This Sony DSC W370 is light, and small enough to slide into a pocket easily. For people with big hands, you might want to attach a long strap to the camera to prevent dropping it by mistake. The menu system is pretty intuitive for settings. Nevertheless, this's a simple point-and-shoot, not much settings for me to play around. The screen is large and bright enough to see on a moderate sunny day. The small battery is the same as the one used in my Sony DSC-TX10. Be aware, the small battery won't hold too much charge (I learned it from using my Sony DSC-TX10), if you plan to use the camera for a long day, you should get a backup battery. The backup batteries are quite available in Amazon, with pretty good price.<br /><br />The built in flash is strong enough to improve the lighting condition for objects in 6 feet range. Time from power-off to photo taking is less than 2 second, which is good for this small camera. The delay between shot is about 1 second if no flash light is used. When flash light is used, you need to wait a little bit longer for charging the flash light, this is pretty typical for camera in this price range.<br /><br />The photo quality is just ok as the photo does not seem to be sharp. When shooting indoor where lighting is weak, you can see some grainy photos. The problem is less when shooting outdoor with good lighting.<br /><br />In video taking mode, the menu already declares that zooming noise will be captured by the camera. I usually edit my videos, so I can silent the zooming noise from the video clips. Not a big issue to me. When you move your camera around in video mode, the camera adjusts the focus continuously. This is a camera, not a camcorder. So, don't move camera too fast, this gives camera time to adjust focus continuously.<br /><br />The panorama mode is just for fun as the panorama photo quality is not very impressive. If you are seriously in creating panorama photos, I recommend to take still shots and create the final panorama photo with photo editing software.<br /><br />The 8x lens is a big selling point for such a small point-and-shoot camera. But the image stabilization does not seem to be strong enough. So, you need a very steady hand to take advantage of the 8x lens, otherwise the photo will be blurry.<br /><br />All in all, for price under $100, this would be a good buy. For price in the $130 range, there might be better options around.

I'm nice too, just not happy.<br /><br />We've had a Paderno spiral slicer since 2012 and get great use out of it.<br />Last week we decided to buy a 2nd spiral slicer for the cabin since we are spending more time up there these days. I told my wife to buy this one because of the good reviews, especially the one from top reviewer RWM.<br />We got it and took our usual bunch of vegetables up and besides the softest ones, the Briefton was not capable enough. Just too flimsy and blades not sharp enough. Ruined our dinner and wife blamed me for choosing it of course.<br /><br />We are returning it but it really should have NEVER been ranked equal or higher than the Paderno!<br /><br />Hope his helps others from wasting their time.

14172	__label2__	4	N	Toys	B00B6BR55U	Ravensburger Science X Nature's Energy Activity Kit	Enrichment in a box.	"My daughter loves science. We were looking for some enrichment activities to keep her interest going (the beginning of year review really got her bored at school).<br /><br />She really took to this kit. The only thing about it was she kept asking for things we didn't have. We buy milk in a jug (requires a carton), I am allergic to apples (need 2), and we just used the last of the tin foil after dinner last night (doh!). We were able to get the items together, but while the kit has a list of what is inside prominently displayed, there is only a small note about the need for ""extra household items"" on the back. You might need to ask your neighbors, but you should be able to get it all together in no time.<br /><br />I think the Since X Nature's Energy kit is well worth the $25 price tag. However, it would be nice if it fell into that $20 limit birthday gift category.<br /><br />Overall: 4 stars. Well put together collection of experiments a kid can do on their own. Just give parents a little more warning about ""items not included."""

Any tribulus product that contains 45% Saponins, is simply not going to compare to a tribulus that contains a high concentration of Protodioscin (the main ingredient responsible for the benefits I gets when taking tribulus).  The most potent form of tribulus is extracted at a ratio of 90%, [[ASIN:B007RLZDBQ Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 50 Grams]].  Even than I would still recommend combining it with some longjack or DAA, if increasing testosterone levels is your main motivation for taking it in the first place.

Although those machines come with a mic and a built in monitor, this has better sound quality, the capability of playing multiple formats as well as playing music from a thumb drive. The only thing I would remind people thinking about buying this is that you have to purchase your  own mics, and hopefully you have a good sound system. (but this is true of most machines).

5865	__label1__	5	N	Books	1477276068	Crossing the Seas: A Diary of My Thoughts	A book that will leave you with a lot to think about in the end	A book spawned with deep intellect and even deeper philosophical meaning comes Yuehai Xiao's Crossing the Seas: A Diary of My Thoughts is a book of sheer empowerment to humankind. This book is written in diary format, which for one I love. It made it so easy to read and to absorb. I feel absorbance is the purpose. When we absorb things we become forced to think about them. Thought is a power motivator in life. People in this world are no longer free thinkers. We watch exactly what is put in front of us, and we accept it as gospel.<br /><br />When you read this book you know acceptance is not option. Xiao's has obviously taken much time and put much thought into this book. We as people have to learn to upgrade our thought process. I for one am an academic. I can test with the best and score high. I have excellent memorization skills. But it goes no further than that. Yes I am memorizing but I have never learned to absorb it. I am 37 years old. And it's truly sad. When it comes to my life I am testing at a D level at best.<br /><br />If we continue on this path of learning and not absorbing we are a doomed species. I think this book it gets to the heart of it all. So our youth can grow, learn and absorb. It has always been about how much you can learn and how fast. It needs to be about what you learn and what you can absorb, and use to help humanity. I believe that this book is trying to help us a people open our minds wider so we can absorb more. It's definitely a book that will leave you with a lot to think about in the end.

Needless to say, I use a whole bunch of overdrive and play loud. The worst problem I had with this setup was the loud hiss that would be produced when I wasn't playing because I have the gains turned up so high. To remedy this, I had to walk over to my rig and hit the &#34;Standby,&#34; button. Now all I have to do is hit the Decimator II pedal and the hiss is gone. I am running it through my effects loop.

13708	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B0092DV0Y6	Hydro Flask  Wide Mouth Flip Lid, Black (Old)	Everything it needs to be	This lid is awesome and it also fits the Klean Kanteen mugs.  I'm sorry Hydro Flask, I can't support your logo, but I will always buy your flip-top lids b/c they are truly leak proof.  Also the gasket comes off if you want it to, so you can periodically soak it in vinegar or whatever to make sure it stays un-moldy.  Edit: I am surprised to read another reviewer describing their experience with the lid breaking quickly.  This is b/c I put smoothies in my thermos and forget to clean the remainder out right away and the pressure builds as it ferments and I can't screw the cap off.  So then I open the little flip-part and use it as my lever to apply pressure to as I'm screwing the lid open and I always think I'm going to snap it off but I never do.  I've done it a million times.  Of course I'm no muscular powerhouse. But I have to say that I've specifically been impressed by how resistant to breakage that flip top is, given that I am applying pressure directly to its weakest point, the hinge, as I twist.  So take this embarrassing story about my tendency to ferment leftover smoothie as a testimony to the flip lid's strength.  Unless you're one of those guys who accidentally snaps the handles off the washing machine and stuff like that.  In that case, you are simply a danger to plastic and no lid is going to survive the terror of your reign.  Why manufacturers are still designing leaking lids after someone figured out how to make a leak proof one is beyond me.  Only 1/100 mugs have leak-proof lids.  How does that make any sense?  You can't tell me that the leaky lids are significantly more ergonomic to drink from, or easier on the eyes.  Are you guys just doing this to screw with us?  Thank you Hydro Flask, for not being a part of this senseless conspiracy.

16435	__label2__	3	N	Video Games	B004M8FUMO	Might & Magic Heroes VI	Great Game If Not For The Bugs!	I love playing MMH6 and I can go hours at a stretch without any issues...until the game freezes!  The sad part about the freezes is that is it usually after just winning a close battle and mostly when I have forgotten to save the game right before the battle (auto-save every day is nice; but, not when I have to do all the things I did up until the freeze all over again).<br /><br />Even worse, in the months since I have bought this game and been playing it, I have scoured the internet almost every time it freezes to see if there is any resolution or if Ubisoft is even paying attention to the mountain of complaints and posts about the freezes (primarily in town screens and with the NVIDIA cards/drivers of which I have dual GTX670s with the latest video drivers).  There is minimal to no response or reaction from Ubisoft nor has there been a fix.  In other words, Ubisoft is ignoring their customers and choosing to work on their expansion that has now been delayed until May 2013 (perhaps to finally fix the freeze issues...like we all want to wait that long).<br /><br />So, overall, I give the game a 5/5 for the fun that it is and only a 3/5 overall because of the bugginess and lack of response/support from Ubisoft to fix the freeze bug while raking in the cash on sales of this and other games!<br /><br />BTW: As for the DRM debate; I don't have a problem with DRM as long as I have the option/ability to play offline with a preference towards also being able to install and activate offline; though, as one reviewer pointed out, it isn't that big a deal to need to install and activate online and then be able to play offline in this age of near mandatory internet connectivity.
12765	__label2__	1	N	Furniture	B004LQ1RJ2	Signature Sleep Contour 8-Inch Independently Encased Coil Mattress with CertiPUR-US Certified Foam, Twin. Available in Multiple Sizes	Buyer Beware - Twin waaay to short	I just received this mattress last week, I was excited to get this after reading a lot of 5 star reviews.  I just opened it up a couple of hours ago, and it is too short for my daughters bed (standard sized twin bed), there is about at least a 4 inch gap between the mattress and her headboard.  The description states this should be 74 inches in length.  Also, it looks so squished on one side, and I sincerely doubt that it will expand fully.  The springs feel super cheap, and you can feel them right through the fabric on top. This may change after another 46 hours, but so far I am extremely disappointed.  If after two days it does not expand in length, or the squished bottom does not expand - I will be returning this, no matter what the cost.  This is a horrible product, beware.  I highly doubt the 5 star reviews are real, as another reviewer pointed out.  I will update in two days (10/31/2014) if my opinion of this mattress changes.  Today is 10/29/2014.  This is the last time I will buy a mattress online ever again.  Amazon is an awesome site, and I am sure they will allow me to return it easily, thank goodness.

Small thing but when shaping some of the spilled over stain made a mess when I started shaping for retention.<br /><br />Middle of the Road:<br />This holster requires a retention screw to out of the box retain the SR9 properly, which it does not have and really can not have as there isn't a reliable space to place it. I'd rather have it compact and be without this.<br />Leather is not stiff enough to provide the retention of a more expensive holster, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was, but it is worth mentioning that for double the money you would be able to hang upside down and still retain the pistol. You can not do that with this model.<br /><br />Pro:<br />The leather is above average quality as far as this price range. Stitching is High Quality and to the par I would use making my own holster of this variety.<br />Comfortable and compact to wear<br />Stitching around the belt slots will keep the holster in better working condition.<br /><br />All that I would likely buy an second one if I was in a pinch for a quick holster.

She says she has to go to the bathroom just so she can use it.  It changes colors every shade of the rainbow and turns off automatically after 10 mins or so.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the base has to be constantly plugged in or it looses it's charge within hours.  I like to have the least number of things plugged in as possible but unfortanately this item needs an outlet always.<br /><br />It's great for little hands, doesn't require perfect position to go onto the base and is just bright enough for children to feel like their not in the dark, but not so bright that you fully wake up out of dreamland.<br /><br />I bought 2 more for my nephews and they love them too!

Just like everyone else, my bulb burnt out in my TV, I decided to go with this brand of replacement bulb for the great price, even though it had mixed reviews.<br /><br />The bulb only lasted two days before burning out. Returning the bulb was a hassle and not worth the time. I got my refund and went with a different bulb here on Amazon that STILL WORKS after three months. I was so relieved to not have to worry about being able to watch my TV or not.<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY replacement lamp, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1x9f9zw<br /><br />It is nearly the same price and is on Amazon as well, trust me you won't be dissappointed!!!

I bought it becuase the store had a good deal on it and I decided to give it a shot.  I think this game has some glitches that should have been worked out before release. But I haven't had some of the problems other reviewers here are saying is in the game. If these glitches were worked out I'd give it five stars. I just don't think it's as bad as some people are saying.

It did have a small nick in the wood, however it was in the back where you can't see it. I love the way it looks, see 5 stars for appearance. I gave it a 4 for durability due to the drawers; they look great, however, you have to be very careful when pulling them open to get your jewelry because the drawers fall out very easily.

They are however too small. Upon further investigation, the brand is Doyeah style 0398. Their description says not for waist over 34. I am 36-37, so they start coming apart in the crotch. I have bought several Doyeah and they are all great, just too small. So 2015 resolution is to lose some weight. I think the Chinese are smaller than Americans

I purchased Walter, the Farting Dog Doll Toy for a neighbors 5 year old child many years ago for a Christmas gift.  HIs parents told me, it was his favorite gift that year, it topped a robot and several other fun toys.  So my 4 year old Grandson thinks 'farting' is funny, so I decided to get him this as one of his birthday gifts this year.  I'm sure his parents won't be happy but I think it's so darn cute, just couldn't resist getting another one.

No doubt the quality is nice but also it doesn't gets weary and the mask is well designed to last long.

8238	__label1__	5	N	Baby	B00SZ184F4	Lil Jumbl Hands-Free Baby Bottle Feeding System	I Love it	Great feeding system when you don't have two hands. I was struggling with the traditional bottles and was subject to performing a juggling act when traveling. Switched to these and they work great! Took the baby a little time to get used to the bottle, but after a few tries he is now a pro. This is totally amazing and it works great. My daughter played with it for a while because she is used to holding a bottle with a nipple attached. But it only took her a few minutes to figure it out. Now she drinks with the nipple in her mouth and uses her hands to play with toys.

12999	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B000E0ODZY	42nd Street (Keep Case Packaging)	Ratings Are Meaningless	Did ya see Al Jolson at the Schubert? Yeah, he was nothing much. Did ya see Crosby at the Paramount? Eh! What about Sinatra when HE was the boy singer for Dorsey playing the Paramount? Skinny Kid.<br />What is there to say about a film that is an essential part of screen history. Ya like it. Ya doan like it. So What! Ya gotta see it if ya wanna talk about da movies.<br />Yes, true, I couldn't stay consistently in character in the first paragraph.<br />Hopefully, though, I did communicate my thought adequately.<br />If you want to understood the roots of the movie musical and what it became, this is one of the earliest polished productions in that history. If you want to see what made the American popular song in pre-Elvis days, listen to the score by two of Broadway's best songwriters, Harry Warren, the Italian guy, and Al Dubin, the Jewish guy. Don't miss the bonus short with Harry Warren at the piano playing some of his many hit songs (while a typical 30's group of singers gather round the piano). Do Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell seem  kind of weak in their roles: the audience loved both through the next years.<br />I can't say I remember seeing it when it was made in 1932, although I was around at the time, but I did see it frequently in the third and fourth run movie houses a few years later. It still enlivens me and I think it will many of you. If nothing else, it will be a compendium of later Hollywood cliches (as well, I should think, of Carol Burnett/Harvey Korman, et al. skits, decades later).

I can't believe this Piece of JUNK (cleaned up for publication) is STILL being sold.  I got one after seeing it at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas (Jan. 2014).  Thought it was a great idea until I tried to get it to work.  IT WOULDN'T.  I contacted their so-called customer service who promised to send me complete instructions.  I waited, and waited.  I contacted them again.  NOTHING.  I packed up the unit and found I couldn't return it BECAUSE...they took too long to get back to me and the 30-day return window had closed.  I took SKYBELL with me this year (Jan 2015) to CES to give it back to these people IN PERSON with a few well-chosen comments...and guess what??  They didn't appear at CES this year.  If you got this POJ to work, congrats.  For me, it's a $200 mistake.

11103	__label2__	5	N	Camera	B00SUY8DF2	FRiEQ® Waterproof Camera Float (2-Pack) - Floating Camera Wrist Strap for Your Underwater Camera - Compatible with GoPro, Panasonic Lumix, Nikon COOLPIX AW110, Canon PowerShot D20, Fujifilm FinePix, Olympus Tough, Marine Binoculars, Camcorders and Other Multiple Small Waterproof Devices	FRiEQ Buoyant Wrist Strap - 2 pack - Bright yellow - Great for waterproof cameras - Works well - Recommended	This buoyant wrist strap from FRiEQ works perfectly to bring your dropped item to the surface of the water, if that is what you seek. The strap is lightweight and comfortable to wear, while being very positively buoyant. If you seek such a strap, I would recommend this one.    We recently received a video camera from SJCam that has a waterproof shell, and have been playing with it in our fish tank and out in the snow (which we have had plenty of these last few weeks). With its waterproof case on, the camera weighs a few ounces so I hooked up this strap to it for our testing... and it went right on up to the top of the tank when let go.    Not too much more to say -- affordable, effective, comfortable and nice looking straps.    As far as hooking this up directly to the camera case (either at a strap port or via a hinge)... it is very easy: make sure that you look closely at the plastic connector on the loop, as this connector allows you to disconnect the loop from the strap. Disconnect it, loop the loop through port or hinge on your camera or device, and then connect the straps back to the loop. Very easy. It seems like some may have missed this, and tried instead to push the straps through the loop...    Neither the Amazon sales page or the retail packaging provides information on a warranty, so if an issue occurs I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive these straps gratis from the seller and put them to use in our fish tank to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.    If you are looking for a high quality pair of highly visible floating wrists straps of this construction, size, style and price, for use as I have noted above, them we would recommend giving these wrist straps from FRiEQ a try based and our experience with them.    Recommended.    Go for it.

19312	__label2__	1	Y	Furniture	B006MISZOC	Zinus 14 Inch SmartBase Mattress Foundation / Platform Bed Frame / Box Spring Replacement / Quiet Noise-Free / Maximum Under-bed Storage, Full	Missing one screw nut	As I opened the package the platform already missed a small part, one screw nut. Because of this my platform is not as steady as described by some other reviewers. I actually like this platform. It is easy to setup, light weighted but because of the missing screw nut, it makes some noise some times. I will look for some contact info to see of they can ship me the one missing screw nut and do some followup comments. Otherwise I will have to do a return and reorder.
19963	__label2__	1	Y	Video DVD	B00FEOYY8G	Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season 6	Really, they sell that bad?	"Apparently the first 5 Seasons didn't sell well enough to get a ""real"" release!<br /> While I'm glad it's from Amazon and not a more expensive MOD service, I<br />can't see how the previous seasons sold so poorly that that we get this...<br />I would love if there was some way to verify the image quality before spending<br />money on this and it also makes me wonder if the series will ever be finished...<br />  This doesn't seem too optimistic for the Hitchcock Hour to ever be released.<br />  Also, these sets were packaged nicely and I don't want a front cover in an Amaray<br />case that doesn't match.<br />  Hopefully the lack of a release date is Universal reconsidering!"

5910	__label1__	5	N	Kitchen	B0077761MU	EastVita Travel Coffee Mug, 24-105mm	Always Ask the Seller for logo!	After hearing all the bad reviews about getting a Caniam brand and such I decided to really research into this.<br /><br />So I emailed many sellers of what their logos were on it. There was only two sellers who told me that they had the Canon logo (W&H Store) and (Pocket Store).<br /><br />I decided to go with W&H Store cause they were cheaper and boy did I make the right choice. Lens came extremely earlier than expected and it did indeed have the Canon logo and Made In Japan text. As a person who loves photography and almost anything to do with it, this mug was a great buy.<br /><br />First thing I tried when I got it was testing if it really kept water in, as told by other reviewers. It leaks water from the drinking spout when you hold it upside down, but of course, the spout is just a hole with a cover, and why would I be drinking coffee upside down? So that didn't really matter.<br /><br />So other than that, this mug was a great buy, looks realistic, holds a nice capacity of coffee, and looks really realistic. I trick a lot of people into thinking It's a real lens when they first see it, so I wouldn't be surprised if I accidentally tried to stick this on my camera from time to time.
11707	__label2__	4	N	Beauty	B00AE07BMQ	AXE Styling Gum Messy Look, 3.2 Ounce	Good Stuff	"I've used hair spray, mousse, gel, wax, and such in my hair through the years, and Axe Spiking Gum (and their Glues) ranks up there with my favorite of these products. It holds as firmly as a hair spray while being easy to apply with your hands like hair gel. I've used a couple other Axe Spiking products (Glues), and this one's as strong but it leaves a nice ""messy look"" after you brush it out. It's a nice look (and I've found that it kind of helps my thinning hair look a little less thin than the Glues).<br /><br />The 3.2 oz size means that you can take in your carry-on baggage for a plane flight - it just slips under the TSA's 3.4 oz limit for liquids and gels. That's rather nice...though I've TSA agents check the size of the package many times.<br /><br />It's got a pleasant smell and just a bit - a drop - is needed to style my hair.

11310	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B00945RAQY	Sony HTCT260 Sound Bar Home Theater System (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	I upgraded my HTCT100 and couldn't be happier - expansive sound, easy setup, and great price - Bluetooth a major bonus as well	"Premium television sets used to advertise their screen size, image sharpness, and sound quality.  Not any more.  When you buy the latest LG, Sony, or any other LCD, LED, or Plasma display, the speakers are always on the back and very tinny with little bass response.  In short, the television manufacturers do not expect you to actually use the speakers in the TV.  Many diehard audiophiles will decide to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on stereo receivers hooked up to surround sound speakers.  For those with lots of money, space, and the time to set it up, these home theaters can be great.  For the rest of us, we want quality sound from our televisions that is compact and easy to setup.  This is the place where the Sound Bar really shines.<br /><br />There are many brands with some similarities - you typically get a long speaker to go under the TV itself, either on its own stand or mounted on the wall.  There is also a separate sub-woofer for deep noise response.<br /><br />This Sony HTCT260 was an upgrade to my existing Sony HTCT100.  Despite similar names, they are quite different.  To start, the Sony HTCT100 was a total of 250W of sound - three 50W speakers in the bar and a 100W subwoofer.  The Sony HTCT260 is 300W - two 85W front speakers and a 130W subwoofer.  Whether the front is two or three speakers is immaterial - they are all inside a single bar.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT100 had a subwoofer that plugged into the wall, and the audio from the source plugged into the subwoofer.  Then the Sound Bar plugged into the subwoofer with a proprietary cable.  That meant the subwoofer had to be near the sound bar.  However, it also meant that the subwoofer was a receiver in itself, with HDMI pass thru, analog input, and optical input.  HDMI pass-thru means you can plug your Blu-Ray player into the subwoofer, and then plug the subwoofer into the TV.  It had multiple HDMI inputs so the Sony HTCT100 could switch between sources.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT260 does away with the HDMI select capability - in fact, it doesn't have HDMI input at all, and the inputs are on the sound bar, not the sub-woofer.  The sub-woofer is a remote wireless device, so it can be placed anywhere, a major bonus.  It is shorter than the HTCT100 subwoofer, despite being more watts, is easier to conceal.  The only inputs are on the bar itself, consisting of Analog, Coaxial, and Optical.  Why did they make this change?  Consider my use of the HTCT100.  When I bought a TV that had networking capability, it meant that half the time I was using my TV, it was for content from the TV itself.  Since my TV had lots of HDMI inputs, it meant every device could also plug into the TV.  I eventually stopped using the HDMI passthrough and just plugged the optical out from my TV into the HTCT100.<br /><br />Since I assume most people have similar televisions now, the removal of the HDMI inputs and the wireless subwoofer of the HTCT260 makes sense.<br /><br />In terms of style, the sound bar is sharp looking, a little longer and wider than the HTCT100, and with a built-in display, it looks really good in my TV setup.  There are touch sensitive input select and volume buttons on the front, so you can adjust it even if you lose the remote control.<br /><br />Most important, how does it sound?  In a word, amazing.  I was dubious that the extra 50W would mean anything, but I found the sound far more immersive and expansive than with the HTCT100.  Previously on the HTCT100, I had actually hit the MAX and still thought the sound was too quiet for some sources, but now I can crank up the volume and actually get it too loud.  The bass is full and can be felt, but is not overpowering.  Simple ""sound field"" buttons on the remote allow you to adjust the effect for movies, games, or music.  With the subwoofer placed in the back of the room, I can achieve most of the surround sound effect without having to run wires and place tons of speakers.<br /><br />Finally, pairing the speaker with my iPhone via Bluetooth couldn't be simpler.  I hit ""Pairing"" on the remote, and about 30 seconds later I was blasting Tchaikovsky through the speakers from the iPhone.<br /><br />Highly recommended - I'm sure you could get better sound with a more expensive system, but bang for the buck, I am totally happy with this sound bar and highly recommend you get one to go with your new television set."
11693	__label2__	4	Y	Luggage	B000SKXRSO	Belle Hop Personal Stash, Ivory	Needs a Closure	This Belle Hop Personal Stash would be perfect if it had some type of closure (which could even be a button).  I placed 2 credit cards, driver's license and some cash in it, which all items fit perfectly, but the money started to move around a little and I believe if there was some type of closure a the top it would give me a piece of mind that the cash would fall out.  It appeared that the credit cards and drivers license wouldn't fall out, but cash possible could depending on how its folded within the pouch.  This is a great product regardless, but it would get 5 stars if they come out with a way to fully secure the items you stash.

As mentioned by another reviewer, the quality of these is not at all like shown in the picture.  Lots of paint smudges and nicks.  I would not recommend purchasing one without being able to see the quality (or lack thereof) in person to make a decision.  Not worth the amount paid.

I got this for the extra battery life. I'm not a big fan of slim cases for protection. I'm really hard on my phone. Works great for prolonging the battery life. Works exactly as advertised as far as that goes. I would recommend it to a friend without hesitation. If you're looking for protection, this is not the best case for you. If you want extra power, this is perfect. One star deducted because of the protection issue, but I knew that when purchased it.

Being all battery operated the detector can be mounted anywhere with a clear line of sight across the driveway and the receiver I am amazed to find can be mounted up to 80 metres away. Yes there will always be false alarms as cats and even birds can trigger it but an excellent device which works well and gives early warning of anybody coming into your property. I also like that the volume of the alarm can be set to high or low depending where you mount it.
11420	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B00O0292FI	Magic in the Moonlight [Blu-ray]	(BLU RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars.  More moonlight than magic	"In Woody Allen's 2014 annual European set film, he goes back in time to the Roaring `20's.  Colin Firth plays Stanley Crawford who is a famous magician who goes by the name and disguise of Wei Ling Soo.  Stanley is approached by his good friend and fellow magician, Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney) to go to England and help him expose a supposed medium who he believes is hoodwinking the wealthy Catledge family into investing a fortune into an organization that promotes supernatural contact with the deceased.<br /><br />Stanley agrees, but like Howard, has a hard time finding the secrets.  In fact, he becomes convinced that the young American, Sophie (Emma Stone) is the real deal after she advances secrets about himself.  Marcia Gay Harden plays Sophie's mother, but really doesn't have much to do.  Jacki Weaver plays Grace Catledge, the widow who is trying to contact her late husband.  Hamish Linklater plays Brice Catledge, the playboy son who is smitten with Sophie and courts her with song and ukulele.<br /><br />This is lightweight stuff to be sure, but Allen offers a fine script and compelling characters to make it enjoyable.  Some of the best scenes are with Stanley and his Aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins) who lives near the Catledge's.  In one particular scene, Stanley argues with himself as to whether he should pursue Sophie.  Vanessa provides one liners that bounce back Stanley's own arguments.  It's funny and sweet.  Granted, we know all is not what it seems but I won't spoil the Agatha Christie-like reveal.  To be sure, this isn't one of Allen's masterpieces or even one of his best.  But I enjoyed it and recommend it, especially to Allen's fans.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The technicians do a serviceable job transferring the film to the digital format.  The filmmakers chose a light hazy, sepia tone to the picture and it is nicely replicated here.  Close-ups are particularly good with fine detail and excellent skin tones consistent with the overall limitations.  Black levels are generally good.  Light grain can be seen throughout.  I was a little surprised to see a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track with this movie.  I seem to remember Allen almost always goes with stereo.  In any case the audio is very good, although the surrounds are mostly in play with the musical score and an early scene when Sophie and Stanley get caught in a thunderstorm.  The dialog centric movie is very clear with most of the audio coming from the center speaker.  The package includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include a piece called ""Behind the Magic"" and another ""On the Red Carpet"" as well as a trailer."

But, now that I'm using these gloves I'm lifting heavier weights and I'm not worrying about my grip, or the weights slowly slipping out of my hands on the last reps.<br /><br />Both my grip and the wrist wraps have been great.

16291	__label2__	3	Y	Furniture	B001KW0C9G	Cherry Queen Mate’s Platform Storage Bed with 6 Drawers	Good for the price, with a little extra work.	Looks great when together.  Going to repeat what some others have said here, you do get what you pay for, it isn't all that sturdy with just their materials.  To alleviate this:<br />1) I put angle braces at each of the 4 corners (these at the top) and then put 4 on each of the corners made from the centerboards (these on the bottom side, right at the floor).<br />2) I screwed down  the slats to the two center rails, two screws per slat per board, and also drilled a small hole through metal rail at the foot of the bed and drove more wood screws there through the slats just to make sure everything stayed where I wanted it, BEFORE doing this make sure the frame is straight and your drawers close all the way!!!<br /><br />It's now really sturdy and doesn't have the wobble it did, only time will tell if this will last now.  As far as the materials, they are cheap (plywood and particle board), but, that's why the price was so low.

19895	__label2__	5	Y	Jewelry	B008F8XG3C	Round Cut 2mm Cubic Zirconia Tennis Bracelet Sterling Silver Gold Plated 6.5” inch	Delightfully surprised!	First, I have to REALLY say that this seller is probably one of the best on Amazon. Very courteous, professional and polite. They very obviously value customer service. All of my rings are princess/emerald cut, so originally I had picked out the sqaure design version of the bracelet. When I went to order it though, it had been sold, so I bought the round cut one instead as a second choice. I was worried about the round shape clashing with the square shape of my engagement ring, but as it turned out, it looked gorgeous and didn't clash AT ALL. On a whim I contacted the seller and inquired about the square cut version that had been sold. The seller got back to me immediately and said it was sold, but if I was still interested he would order another one for me. I was totally floored. I did not think customer service existed at that level before. Within the week, the seller contacted me to tell me that he received the square version and JUST listed it on amazon. I immediately ordered it. Within 2 days my bracelet arrived. It is absolutely stunning. I have had it for a month and have not taken it off since it arrived. Wonderful service, wonderful product.....I just wish I could give this item and seller TEN gold stars!

10851	__label2__	4	Y	Musical Instruments	B00CE0VLXO	"Electro-Voice ZLX12P Two-Way Powered 12"" Loudspeaker"	A great utility speaker for live sound applications	I bought six of these plus an EV ZXA1 powered subwoofer and I am satisfied with my purchase so far. They've been used as a monitor rig for my much larger QSC KW system and also as a mini rig for small clubs where the speakers filled both main and monitor roles. The inboard DSP works really well to smooth out the peaks and clipping and it allows for perfect Xover free matching of subs and tops. I used a pair of these tops with a pair of QSC KW 181 subwoofers and it worked in that configuration as well. They are not exceptionally loud, but they will do small rooms pretty well and have no problem working as floor monitors. Along with one of the ZXA1 powered subwoofers I was able to fit six of these and a 12 channel mixer in a tiny Toyota Corolla for a gig at VA Beach. I even brought lights and stands and it all fit in there with no problems. I surprised some veteran musicians who at first judged my mini rig as underpowered from the looks alone, when I turned up the kick drum during soundcheck to reveal that this full range system does not lack low frequency extension (in fact the sub provided the kick drum thump we all know and love!). It really is a good sounding system that gives the venerable QSC K12 a run for the money. I hope to get many miles out of these speakers.

18644	__label2__	3	Y	Sports	B000NNPAPE	BLACKHAWK! Omega VI Ultra Universal Modular Light Holster, Coyote Tan	Had To Return This	I bought this drop leg holster because I wanted a versatile platform that would accomodate several pistols with or without lights. I like the fact that it can also be used as a belt holster or attached to a vest.<br />Pro: Versatile, holds pistol without light somewhat securely (read cons), durable materials, very good craftsmanship<br />Con: You do have to set up the holster to fit your size and weapon. Not really a con but rather a fact. However, the instruction manual to set up the holster is lacking. The technical writer needs to be smacked in the back of the head. Clearer diagrams would have been helpful. Once you figure it out, the set up is not too bad if not a bit finicky. The holster IS bulky. I have a Bladetech Revolution holster attached to a Bladetech drop leg platform and it has a narrower profile. I wanted a drop leg that you could roll around on the ground with. I scratched up the Kydex on the Bladetech doing this. While the material is very durable it's also quite stiff. It'll probably soften up with use. I can't seem to get the bellows that accomodates the light to close down enough to prevent the pistol from rocking a bit fore and aft(the pistol doesn't have a light attached).<br /><br />Addendum: I had to return this holster due to the retension strap snap not being strong enough and the bellows being too loose. The rocking of the pistol fore and aft became a real issue. I could not cinch the bellows down enough to prevent this. I took a Weapons Retension course one night and one of the drills was to have others try and take your pistol (unloaded and safety checked, of course) from your holster. Because the bellows is held down by velcro straps a quick yank rearward would release the straps and loosen the pistol enough that anyone could easily pull out the pistol. Not good in any situation. I think it might have been different if I was running the pistol with a light but I wanted the option to go with or without the light on the pistol. I'm rethinking this strategy and am considering a drop leg dedicated to the make and model of my pistol.
10886	__label2__	3	N	PC	B00CPH56AU	Belkin @TV Premium - Mobile Television Anywhere (Product and Service Have Been Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Not completely satisfied	"The first issue I had with the Belkin @TV was that it has a component/composite connection.  I was already using these connectors on my dvr to hook up another piece of equipment.  It took me a little time (and extra purchase) to get the @TV connected.  Once I had it connected, I then went to download and install the app on my android phone, which I thought was free.  When I saw the fee for it, I was taken aback.  I ""know"" that before getting the @TV system, that I had read it was free.  I went back onto Amazon and reread everything.  Then I realized the tricky (in my opinion) wordplay where it says free tablet app.  No, they were not lying, but it's a slight bit shady (once again, in my opinion).  So I then paid the money for the app, on top of the extra money I needed to spend to hook up the connectors.  I've used a slingplayer in the past and understand that the system is going to occasionally have some glitches.  I had problems viewing on my phone more often than I did with the old slingplayer I had used.  Since I have it installed and paid for the app, I will continue to use it some on a limited basis I guess.  Hopefully either future app updates or software upgrades to the system will help things run a bit more smoothly."

I have to amend my review and downgrade this product to 1 star.  X-Rite recently issued a software update and things went from bad to worse. The software was iffy to begin with. After the upgrade, it no longer shows test results, so you can't see how close your monitor is to the selected parameters. At one point the program became totally unresponsive and I had to shut it down manually. When the &#34;upgrade&#34; was first installed it would display the test results for a couple of runs, then it stopped doing so.  Before the software upgrade, the program was functional if quirky. Now it's useless. I hate to spend the money twice but I may have to. Now I'm looking for a better program with software that isn't so flaky.

14611	__label2__	5	Y	Luggage	B003QZ0ODY	LEGO Bags Soccer Vertical Lunch Bag	the lunch bag with the same effect as a clown car!!	"I was hesitant to purchase this lunch bag for my 6 year old mainly because of the size. Aesthetically I liked it, I know my son will like it also because of the football and it matched with his green samsonite school bag.<br /><br />When the lunch bag arrived I sighed because it looked small but I tested it putting all the paraphernalia I send my son with to school. I will be detailed to give you an idea: 1 juice (Welch's 10fl. oz.)or Apple's and Eve box juice, 2 snacks (if it is the size of potato chips) 3 snacks if it is smaller packed snack like a granola bar or 4 biscuit snacks, 1 bowl for his lunch (approx 2 1/2"" deep 3"" wide square shaped), 1 small towel (so he can use as a table mat for his lunch), 1 small bottle of hand sanitizer (a 2 or 3oz bottle, small)  and 1 fork or spoon when necessary. Let me tell you, I dont regret buying that lunch bag for 1 second! Everything fit perfectly!<br /><br />We had issues with the last lunch bag we bought on amazon (not amazon's fault the make of the bag needed some tweaking for the use of a child) whenever my son held the handle the flap pulled with the weight due to the contents of the bag. Complete opposite with this lunch bag (besides it not having an opening flap) when my son holds this lunch bag containing the aforementioned items, its very manageable for a child and weighs (feels) almost 'light'. I dont know how that is possible but it is.<br /><br />Cleaning is easy, I guess you could follow the instructions. I just use a damp cloth and it wipes clean. It looks like it may last more than one school year! By the way, my son has been using it since the beginning of the new school year and it is going strong. I highly recommend this lunch bag."

12733	__label2__	4	Y	Camera	B00P8BOEXA	Photomate 15 inch Hi-Resolution Digital Picture Frame with Motion Sensor & 4GB Built-in Memory	Almost perfect	So far, we like the frame. We bought it to use at our county fair for a digital photography class. 4 stars only because it doesn't hold the program after you turn it off and you have to reset it each time you turn it on. Also, your choice of time for each frame is 3 sec. 5 sec. then 15 seconds. 7 to 10 would be perfect. You can turn off the motion sensor so it keeps playing if no one is around, which is what we need. I put various sized pictures on it and they all filled the screen correctly without shrinking or stretching so that part will work great for what we're doing. The pictures display great, very representative of what they looked like coming off the camera which is what we need for judging. I'm trying video on it next week. I'll update if it doesn't work as expected.  UPDATE: I can't get more than 5 pictures to show from the 30 on the SD card or on the USB drive. Same 5 pictures. Also, I haven't been able to get it to recognize any videos that I've tried to show. I have it saved as an AVI but it doesn't recognize it. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!

All other compartments are extremely useful and sufficient for all of my little gadgets, one 1-1/2 3-ring binder, and a lunch sack!  The construction quality is bar none as its name bares.  I originally had a bit of reservation about the quality of the wheel (for not having seen and felt it), but now that I have used it for over three months, everything is holding up like a Samsonite should do!  And the wheels are a life saver too considering the total weight of around 25lbs between the bag itself and all of the contents on my average day, that I can roll around instead of wearing it on my shoulder.<br /><br />Highly recommend this to anyone who have a need to lug around a heavy lap top and some ....

2936	__label1__	3	N	Camera	B0090UMKRW	DNA 5050# Glide Gear Professional Video Camera Camcorder Stabilizer USA COMPANY LIFETIME WARRANTY	A Win-Win!	As an amateur, the price of the DNA5050 thrilled me. After getting it, I had a change of heart with my purchase. Don't get me wrong, I think that it's great. The truth is, it  didn't really fit my needs but the price sold me. It's way cheaper than another stabiliser of similar make that I've been eyeing for a while and I guess it was an impulse buy.<br /><br />In any case, there's nothing wrong with it. I spent a few weeks getting to know this Glide Gear stabiliser--I particularly enjoyed the easy release mounting plate--but in the end, it was not for me (my cameras are on the smaller and lighter side of basic, most often used is a Sony pj200 camcorder) and carrying the 5050 for teeny tiny cameras just felt and looked stupid. I ended up trading it with a friend for oddly enough another Glide Gear product (the DNA1000), which had come out later.<br /><br />So all things considered, it was still a great purchase. I avoided wasting and losing out on an impulse buy, got a great stabiliser along with a few other things that matched well with my cameras, and I bagged a lot of good will too.

No issues at all, same beautiful design, and came with the same extra accessories. THE best infuser bottle that I have ever used. I am beyond satisfied with the service. Thank you!  I first gave this bottle a 3-star review when I received it. The bottle was wobbly (unstable when placed on a flat surface), and it was leaky. A representative contacted me through e-mail, concerned about my experience with the product. Apologizing and assuring that all of their bottles go through leak testing and quality control, he really wanted to see how the bottle was leaking. He kindly asked me if I can send him a video of the leaking bottle, and wanted to send me a new bottle. Once he saw the video of the bottle, he sincerely apologized over and over again and said this bottle should have never passed quality control. I received a defective bottle, and hey, it happens, and it happens all the time even with big companies. Not everyone and everything is perfect. I understand that as a small company, one defective product can impact the business and it can be very frustrating. I loved how this company handled this issue. They handled it like I would have handled my own business if I were the owner. They are very professional and I highly recommend them. Thanks again!

You get what you pay for, basically.  It's lightweight, but feels cheap...head movement is minimal and any attempt to swivel will result in some severe choppiness.  I felt like I was going to break it most of the time while using it, which isn't the best feeling when you're working with expensive equipment on top.

13113	__label2__	5	Y	Tools	B0014VRLVA	Accu Sharp 008 OD Green Knife Sharpener	Great Sharpener	We do a lot of cooking and we have quite a few stainless steel knives of various sizes in the kitchen. Over the years, some of these knives have become pretty dull. We have tried all sorts of sharpeners - stones and the like - and nothing really worked. I read the reviews on this one and they were good. Because the price is right, I decided to give it a try - If this was no better than the others we have tried, I was only out a few dollars.<br /><br />Well, this sharpener is amazing! I cannot believe how well it works. I took the dullest knives we had, set this sharpener on the counter top facing up, and then ran a knife through the slot a few times. you could feel the bite of the sharpening stone against the blade and actually see metal filings falling onto the counter top. This thing was doing some serious work. After 4 swipes or so, I cleaned off the blade and tried to run it through a ripe tomato I had on the counter - wow - just like using a razor blade on the tomato. It sliced through like butter. This knife has never been so sharp. I did all my knives with the same results.<br /><br />This is an amazing sharpener. The directions are simple. I don't know how well it works for ax blades or other things, but it sure works good on kitchen knives. A+ for me.
11117	__label2__	5	N	Home Improvement	B00CWKT8T0	Electronix Express Portable 10W COB Type Super Bright LED Work Light Rechargeable Flood Lights Lamp	Suprisingly lightweight + powerfully bright.	"[[VIDEOID:90ec5d5ac337c1e210d84232efc67438]] Note: The company who sells this light (Thefancy) sent me this to test, review, and demonstrate.  I hope my video review is helpful for you. (and in my humble opinion, the folks at Thefancy are very nice people.  No I don't work for them, but they're definitely someone you should buy through.)<br /><br />I use this for filming videos when I need more brilliant, white light.  I also have this out on my workbench, ready for big projects.  This would also work perfectly simply resting in the back of your car, waiting for the moment when you need a huge dose of light when changing a tire.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Weather resistant (tough little guy)<br />- Incredibly bright.  I was stunned.<br />- Portable: Small and lightweight.<br />- Tough: There's no real ""bulb"" to break. It's just this little LED-looking diode.<br />- Grippy foam handle.<br />- Minimal parts to put together when it arrives (just screw the bottom on and *bam* you're good to go.<br />- Came full charged in the box.<br />- Fast charge, surprisingly long batter life (+3 hours).<br />- Rocker switch (on/off) is covered with a rubber protector, so if you have wet hands it there's less risk of water leaking into the electronics.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- My friend was rummaging around in the back cargo area in our SUB, looking for something, anything.  She finds this flood light. The front car lights up from within as she switches on the light. The dinosaur raises its head.  It turns slowly from the second car to the first car, drawn by the light.  Making a decision, it strides over to the first vehicle.<br /><br />Overall very good engineering and design.  I'm very surprised how brilliant this little brick of dynamite is. 5/5 stars."

As such whenever she is playing with that section I have to watch closely to ensure that she does not break it.<br />Feet are easily removed after putting them on (I say this because I had to return another brand that said the feet are a easy snap on and off to use in dual mode)<br />Product would be much better if the feet had something on the bottom that prevented it from sliding. It slides both on carpet and on tiles. Also, slides on the rubber ABC mat.<br /><br />Other than those I think it is a good buy. I like the option it gives to put it in a particular mode Spanish, music only etc.<br /><br />Would recommend to friend who has a similar need.

"This was supposed to be purchased new and given as a Christmas present. I had moved and did not get to open the box until a few days before Christmas. The power base has rust and mold and other substances inside and all around it (that only God knows what they are), the sets of blades have the same disgusting crust and crud in them!! The two cups are just as disgusting, they are grimy and covered with foreign substances. One of the cups actually is melted and the other is beaten up and scratched. The electrical wire has disgusting dried substances on it as well. They look old and used as if they were part of an antique set. I am thoroughly disgusted with this package. Unfortunately I cannot return it but I will NEVER purchase from the seller again. What specifications allows someone to call these products new? I believe someone needs new glasses to re-evaluate what they are identifying as NEW and selling to customers. The only part of this product that is new are the 4 mugs and 4 colored comfort lip rings and the 4 lids (sealed/vented). Thank you for wasting my $48.00 and not allowing me to be able to give this as a gift. Pictures are attached so that it can be seen what I received, again this is straight out of the box and not used by myself.

19941	__label2__	1	N	Wireless	B001RH62YS	Scosche FMTD3R Digital FM Transmitter with Flex Neck and Digital Display- for iPods, iPhones, ipads, MP3 Players, Smartphones, and Tablets	Does not hold on to the transmission.	I bought the Scosche FMTD3 to use in my car to listen to audio books during long distance driving. After about 20 hours of use over multiple trips, the devise suddenly drops the carrier and the transmission ceases. I turn the unit off and then back on and the carrier and the transmission resumes. After about 1 minute it drops the carrier again. I turn it off and back on and the carrier and frequency are back on. For the next hour, this process consistently repeats about every 60 seconds. I contacted the Scosche technical people and they graciously tell me to send it back to them and they will replace it, which I do and they do.  A couple of weeks later I receive what appears to be a new FMTD3, in a new box.  I open it and put it in the car and go for a drive with my MP3 and audio book playing.  In about 2 minutes the FMTD3 drops the carrier and the frequency is gone. I turn it off and back on to reestablish the connection. About 2 minutes later the same thing happens. This continues to happen about every 2 minutes for the next half hour.  This is the second unit that cannot continuously transmit. Is this a coincidence or is this a manufacturing flaw?  I'm done with it - enough is enough.<br /><br />I bought another unit from a different manufacturer.  It works fine.  I'm going to throw away the Scosche FMTD3.<br /><br />I do not recommend that you buy this brand and model.  Maybe my experience was a fluke but, do you really want to take that chance?

10875	__label2__	5	N	Kitchen	B001DTDEUU	Anolon Advanced Bronze Hard Anodized Nonstick 12-Inch Covered Deep Skillet	A Darn Good Skillet!	I have the 10-piece Anolon cookware set and just love it.  In addition to being aesthetically appealing in the bronze, Anolon is a high end, high caliber cookware.  I love every single piece of Anolon I own and use today.<br /><br />What makes this 12&#34; deep skillet distinct is that you can also use it as a wok.  Having the long handle makes it much easier when you stir fry.  One Anolon trademark is that the handles don't tend to get hot when you cook or bake.  Add to it is Anolon is chef tested and restaurant approved.<br /><br />To make a good thing even better, this skillet is not heavy and is very easy to work with.  It cleans easily after each use.  Your food cooks evenly and thoroughly.  Anolon is also noted for its nonstick products and I have had only positive experiences with Anolon products.<br />..

14032	__label2__	4	Y	Home Improvement	B0045LSFBG	Sprite White Bath Ball Filter (White, 1)	Works pretty well!	I was a bit skeptical prior to purchasing this filter due to the mixed reviews but so far I've been really pleased with this bath ball filter!  The Velcro straps have held strong and the product was very easy to install. My bath spout is very similar to the one pictured but I imagine it would not work on anything much different than that due to it's design and the plastic support arm that goes underneath.  I am not able to adjust the water pressure when filling the tub (it's just one single handle) so some of the water doesn't get filtered but I'd say at least 90% does which is a lot better than nothing in my opinion.<br /><br />Our water doesn't have an odor so I can't say whether it helps with that or not but I did notice that my skin felt significantly less dry than normal after two baths so I'm confident it's working.

18579	__label2__	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B008WTO8KY	WARRIOR SUPREME,MOSQUITO BUG ZAPPER,HIGHEST POWER OF ANY RACKET 4000V MADE,FAST	Works on Cluster Flies but get the C cell model	Works on Cluster Flies! The first &#34;Tennis racket of Death&#34; that was sent to me was defective. It happens. The company then sent a replacement but it was an AA model and not the one I ordered which was the C cell. I bought an older farmhouse and needed this for the bugs that are there. Which at this time of year consist of Cluster Flies and Asian Lady Beetles. The AA model took like 6 hits to kill a cluster fly. Sometimes they would drop on the ground and get up fairly quickly. Asian Lady Beetle which sort of look like a ladybug but aren't, tnded to die after being zapped a couple of times.<br />Once the C cell model arrived Cluster flies would die in 1-2 zaps and ALB's would die with one hit. If you've never dealt with either of these pests they are super annoying and can get into the tiniest of spaces. Cluster flies will ply dead by laying on their backs and hide in cracks so tiny you can't figure out how they fit. Lady beetles are worse. When the light and heat comes on these bugs come out in force and both will bite. I fully expected these bugs to explode like popcorn but they are super tough as well as clever. They will walk rather than fly. No idea how this will work on wasps or hornets but will find out in the spring.<br />If you want something that kills quick you really need the bigger model. For stuff like spiders and mosquitos the AA model should work well. For hardier insects get the C cell model you will need it.<br />also be very careful if you go after web spiders. The webs can make contact with the electrical contacts and it will pop and zap as if it were a bug on it. The product works well and as advertised but some bugs are tougher to kill than others and you really shouldn't kill Asian lady beetles with this because they stink pretty bad when they pop from being zapped. I accidentally killed a stink bug with this and whoo wee! did it ever smell. Lady beetles aren't as bad but they do reek when they die.

15232	__label2__	4	Y	Shoes	B003JV0U7U	Women's 3 Inch Heel Witch Shoe (Black PU;10)	Cute but large	I was so worried these boots were going to run small because of costume shoes, but they're actually pretty big.  I could have gotten away with a 9.5.  They're on the long side and kind of funny when you walk because the toe bends oddly because there's so much space in the pointed toe.  I wonder if a smaller size would have helped with that.  Overall I really like them.<br /><br />For reference I'm a 10.5 (Nine West, Tory Burch) but can wear 10s (Sperrys, Hunters) and wear a lot of 11s (Steve Madden, L.K. Benett, Stuart Weitzman, Kate Spade).  Pretty much anything with a heel is going to be an 11 since most shoes don't do a half size.<br /><br />I also have flat feet, but they're on the narrow side of average width.  So I had to lace the booties tighter.

However that being said who is the 'boss' of these types of bags and says that so very few of them are vacuum seal but most are the roll-up only bags?  Having used both I do not understand why ANYONE would ever actually PREFER the roll-up option and I think they would even be next to impossible for someone with say, arthritis or other strength/dexterity issues to use. I don't have any of those health issues and MY hands, fingers and wrists were killing me when I was done 'rolling' these bags.

15205	__label2__	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B002UD5H5I	Pow' R' Kraft 65575 7-Ton 15 amp 2-Speed Electric Log Splitter	Works as Described	I had misgivings about losing the power of a gas operated splitter. Needn't have worried. The Pow' R' Kraft is just as advertised. For slightly more money than a 5 ton, this baby has split everything I've thrown at it, including Oak, Cherry and Dogwood. Of several cords, I've only had to &#34;turnaround&#34; about three logs to get the proper leverage. It's quiet, efficient and easy to get used to. I think the best splitting method is to start the split on low speed and, once the &#34;crack&#34; is heard or felt, let the machine speed through the rest. It is rated for 12&#34; maximum diameter, but I've got up to 16&#34; without a problem. Once in a while, with really green wood, the splitter won't complete the job and some shards will remain, holding the two halves together. Then you have to resort to elbow grease. But I believe this to be true with any splitter, gas or electric.<br /><br />Overall, a great buy that has already paid for itself, and should continue to for many years.

588	__label1__	1	N	Health & Personal Care	B0008IVPB2	Slim Fast Original, Meal Replacement Shake Mix, Rich Chocolate Royal, 31.18 Ounce	WARNING: Do not buy!!!! Waste of Money and a DOES NOT WORK!!!	I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----> http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.

BUYER BEWARE!	I have had years of professional experience in testing batteries, from aerospace to hearing aid batteries. I know how to test batteries & I have the equipment. I tested these based on the standard slow 20 hour discharge rate, not a high rate which makes the batteries look even worse.<br /><br />This battery company is basically running something like a scam. I bought a total of 6 of these at 2 different times. My tests show that on average, they don't even measure up to a 1/3 of the 3000 mAh level claimed by UltraFire. One went totally dead after using only once.<br /><br />Furthermore, they only have about the same power level as found in a triple pack of AAA batteries.<br /><br />Therefore, buying these batteries makes no sense at all. Save yourself time & trouble & stay with lights that use the triple pack of AAA batteries. Keep it simple......

I was so impressed I kept my grip on the hot iron handle to see how much longer before I felt anything. I began to notice the sensation of heat at about 15 to 20 seconds. I did not maintain my grip after that and set the pan down. I didn't think it wise to maintain prolonged contact with such a hot piece of iron regardless of how effective of a heat protectant this glove may be.

13136	__label2__	4	N	Baby	B0066CJF7A	FunBites Hearts - Cuts kids' food into fun-shaped bite-sized pieces . . . Great for picky eaters and bento!	You'll either love it or hate it!	For the record, I rarely give ANYTHING 5 stars, so don't let that mislead you into thinking there's anything wrong with this product!<br />As far as cutters go for food, this is one of the easiest to use, because of the thing that pushes the shapes back out. Trust me. When using a cutter for small shapes, that's a HUGE advantage! I don't have to poke them out of each hole with a finger!<br />Cleaning CAN be frustrating, if you're cutting gooey foods. You'll want to do a quick swipe with a bottle brush in each compartment before putting the pushing tool in and running the whole thing through the dishwasher. For foods that aren't gooey, should be fine to just put the parts together and dishwasher them.<br /><br />I personally am not a big fan of the triangles making a heart. I can never seem to get the pieces to stay in the cutter before popping them intact onto a plate, so I end up having to reverse-engineer the layout, and feel like a lab monkey. HOWEVER, they are GREAT for making OTHER shapes, like kites, boats, ice cream cones, etc. And the heart-shaped holes are amazing on harder foods, like carrot coins! With the mini metal cutters, I usually end up with bruises on my palms after cutting a bunch out. Not with this! It feels almost like cheating...<br /><br />I haven't come up with a solution to the sandwich fillings bloobing out the sides or splitting through the top of the bread, for gooey fillings like toasted cheese or PBJ. You can cut the bread first, then make a zillion tiny little sandwiches (No thanks!) Or I just give my daughter the bread shapes and some PB and Jelly in little cups and let her dip. Fun! I also give her a knife to spread her own, if she so chooses. This is not a problem with non-melted meat and cheese sandwiches, pancakes, fruit, veggies like carrots and cucumbers, etc.

13474	__label2__	5	Y	Camera	B0012X43P2	Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 DG Macro Motorized Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras	Amazing for the price!	I just bought a Nikon D5100 and the kit leans just didn't have enough reach for me. I really didn't want to pay $300-$500 for a longer lens and I'm glad I didn't have to.<br /><br />This has to be the best bang for the buck lens out there. It takes really sharp images, especially macro.<br /><br />I've read some complaints that you need a tripod to shoot macro otherwise you can't get it focus or get a blurry photo. However, my experience has been different. I've had absolutely no trouble shooting at 300mm in macro holding it with just my hands. I was absolutely shocked at how detailed and clean the image was, especially since it doesn't have image stabilization.<br /><br />My dad was visiting and he was blown away with the image quality of the lens. He was even taking some photos with it and said he was impressed with how fast it took photos. I trust his opinion a lot because he's been doing photography for almost 40 years, if not longer.<br /><br />If you want a very nice macro lens you really cant go wrong with the Sigma. I would give it more stars if I could because that's how good it is.<br /><br />Update 4-27-14<br /><br />So far I'm still enjoying the lens but I'm starting to notice the auto-focus isn't very good. It zooms in and out multiple times and still wont focus. Sometimes it does focus, other times it takes multiple tries before it works. I've got into the habit of just manually focusing since it's faster and the pictures seem to be more clear than using AF. I'm not deducting a star because I still believe the lens is great for the price and still takes really nice images. The AF problem is more of an annoyance than anything for me.

I think I am going to order more as I now want to pickle ginger and garlic these jars will be perfect for that purpose. It is a great product.
15794	__label2__	3	Y	Video Games	B003O6N64Y	Ear Force PX5 Programmable Wireless 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound Headset with Bluetooth	Not worth the price	I owned this headset for about 6 months and sold it. I didn't like the wireless because it would always have interferance. Also, the batteries would always be changed about three times a week. I only used them for online gaming and played about 5 nights out of the week. The sound is amazing though and the different sound settings are easy to use. They are very durable and the stand that is included on the receiver is very useful. As far as setting it up with consoles, I didn't have any problems and only connected the optical cable and USB for power so that was pretty easy. I did use them connected to my iPhone which was awesome because if I wasn't using the mic I would just listen to my music while I was playing and you can still hear the game too. Overall, it isn't worth the retail price ($300) which I bought it at. It would be if it was wired.

Get the 2.0 version with no sub if you live in an apartment.	I bought this at costco onsale for $129.99. I live in a studio apartment, which has wooden walls/floors (loud, not great insulation). The main thing that travels through walls is vibrations, e.g. BASS.<br /><br />I hooked this guy up and turned the subwoofer ALL the way down, and the bass was still very loud and exaggerated. The sound quality is decent if you want a cheap soundbar and you have a well insulated CONCRETE apartment/condo, or you live in a house and don't have anyone to disturb.<br /><br />The base is very loose, loud, and exaggerated, not great, and it cannot be EQ'd down. I returned this soundbar and bought the 2.0 equivalent (in the mail still), which lacks a subwoofer and therefore will be appropriate for an apartment.<br /><br />If you live in an apartment you should get the 2.0 version. It will lack bass, but your neighbours will thank you.

I'm not adverse to taking pills, I can swallow a headache tablet or Prilosec without water, then drink the glass of water afterwards. But these things are huge!

15613	__label2__	5	Y	Automotive	B002XLHUQG	X-Chock Wheel Stabilizer - Pair - One Handle - 28012	Super solid	Super solid. Bought these before my first RV trip, and used them often on our 4 month trip around the US. Don't need them on level ground. Once, I was on fairly unlevel ground and only used regular chocks as I was a little lazy. Jacked up the tongue and the thing slid off the blocks I had under it ! Ever since then, if I am at all concerned about slippage, I put in one or sometimes both of these and the TT won't move a millimeter. They would be perfect if they somehow had a &#34;release&#34; that would allow you to collapse or expand them quickly, then only have to use the included ratchet wrench to tighten or loosen them the rest of the way. If you only have a tight space to store them, its annoying to have to crank them down to make them small. I ended up using my electric drill with the same socket as that for the stabilizer jacks on the trailer to quickly open or close them.

It doesn't come inflated, for obvious reasons, so you have to get it inflated; however, they had the genuine Hello Kitty balloons at the market that were the same &#34;smaller&#34; size I received. So... all in all it was a waste of time and money because general stores try not to fill non-store bought balloons. A big hassle, although, the balloon costs less than a dollar.

19681	__label2__	1	Y	Furniture	B001FOR94A	Target Marketing Systems Wood Corner Desk with One Drawer and One Storage Shelf, Black Finish	Don't Buy This Table	I wish I would have read the reviews on this piece of crap before I bought but no, as usual I didn't.  I have never been so frustrated on putting together a piece of furniture as I have with this blasted table.  You have to juryrig it together - takes two people, don't try to do it yourself like I did.  The holes to screw the bottom shelf and front of table on are too big for the screws, you screw it on and it falls off.  The camlocks are pieces of junk, you can't screw the camlock bolt in too far or it won't even reach the camlock, so they are barely screwed in to be able to use them in the camlock.  I've had to drill new holes, glue like crazy pray that it will stay together because I'm too stubborn to send it back.  Warnings to buyers - don't buy this!!!!
17255	__label2__	1	Y	Watches	B00ATUJMBO	Invicta Men's 11292 Specialty Chronograph Navy Blue Textured Dial Black Polyurethane Watch	Watch out.	This is the second Invicta watch of this same model (different color) I've purchased. I really like the style, look and feel of it. It keeps great time and is waterproof (a must for me because I wear it 24/7 in the shower and pool). The complaint I have is that the chronographs' pushers stick in a very short time (1 week) which makes it quite difficult to start or stop and essentially useless. My first watch has the same issue.<br />I cut Invicta some slack figuring this was an anomaly and went ahead to puchase the second watch. Buyer beware!<br />I think of Invicta as a quality watch company but they've really dropped the ball on this one and hence the 1 Star rating I'm giving it.<br />If you are purchasing this watch to actually use the chronograph think again. If that function isn't important to you go ahead and buy it because it is otherwise a great watch.

Meaning the Brightech Remix5 has already been dropped several times and it still sounds awesome!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to taking this camping in Yosemite this spring!! The Remix5 is water resistant, not water proof, so it will work if it gets rained on but not so much if it's dropped in the lake or ocean!<br />The Remix5 has output of 5W which is perfect for me, I'm happy with the clear sound, distinct bass and all around great sound.<br />The bottom  of the Remix5 has a small black on and off switch, a micro-USB input for charging, a tiny microphone hole and a small bright blue LED light that lights up when the power is on.<br />Turn on the Remix5 there are five ascending beeps that verify it's ready to pair and pairing is super fast and easy!! Seriously it pairs faster and easier than some of my other speakers! About 10 seconds and the Remix5 speaker was paired with my iPad.<br /><br />BONUS!! There is a hinge flap that folds over this compartment space to cover and protect it from the elements. PERFECT for camping and trips to the beach.  The speaker itself is covered with a bright red screen for great protection.<br />On the outer corner of the Remix5 flush with the black rubber coating are three buttons; play, plus and minus; press the forward button for the next song and minus for the previous song.<br />What's in the box; The Remix5 speaker, a charging cord with the Micro-USB port on one end that splits into two cords; one the USB port for charging and the other a 3.5mm cord for accessing music from another source than Bluetooth. Brighttech also includes a thick rubber wrist strap that can be attached to the device.<br /><br />I received a Remix5 for the purpose of this review. Opinions are 100% my own.

Just like everyone else, my bulb burnt out in my TV, I decided to go with this brand of replacement bulb for the great price, even though it had mixed reviews.<br /><br />The bulb only lasted two days before burning out. Returning the bulb was a hassle and not worth the time. I got my refund and went with a different bulb here on Amazon that STILL WORKS after three months. I was so relieved to not have to worry about being able to watch my TV or not.<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY replacement lamp, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1hbRRnT<br /><br />It is nearly the same price and is on Amazon as well, trust me you won't be disappointed!!!

Instead of having two Pvc pipes through the outside wall, you have a clean cut look that goes well with any home. Styrofoam is sturdy and very hard. It present itself as a durable product. One side for clean outside air and the other side for the exhaust. Considering the furnace is a high efficient to super efficient only. Any other furnace I would recommend contacting the manufacture.

16164	__label2__	4	Y	Musical Instruments	B0007P34Z6	SoundOff by Evans Drum Mute, 12 Inch	It works and it is affordable	Since I don't want to drop money for an electronic set just because I want to practice at night, this is an excellent way to mute my drum heads. I know some complain about the smell, but it really depends where you store your drums. I practice in the garage and I don't smell the tire rubber smell at all (or it doesn't overpower the actual smell of my car tires). If you use them for an extended period of time and you pound on the drums, the rubber might rub off on the  drum. My only complaint is that it doesn't 100% resemble the bounce of a real drum head; and if I practice too long on these, my sticks are flying in the air because I need to adjust to the bounce of a real head. But, I can adjust this problem a few minutes into a gig or practice, it is better to have something I can practice on in the late hours of the night.

I use it to protect an ipad mini from a 6yr old. Very durable, excellent drop protection, very useful ""handle"" that folds back to provide tilt when used on a lap or desk, also props up like a mini lcd for watching movies etc. My only concern is the handle may pull apart from the case, as it is apparently secured with two very small steel pins. So far this has not been an issue, the case has been in use for several months and is holding up well.<br /><br />I recommend this case for anyone considering an ipad mini for child. I would definitely buy it again."

I wish our goods were made somewhere besides China. The pre-drilled holes did not match up precisely, making the assembly a real headache. The illustrations shown in the directions were reversed with my product, so I was nearly finished with the first part of the assembly when I discovered the discrepancy. The perches for the cats will not thoroughly tighten when you screw them on but so far nothing bad has happened to my cats. If you are lucky enough to get a &#34;good&#34; package as some consumers obviously have, then lucky for you. I would have sent this whole thing back if it didn't cost as much as the item itself. I am better satisfied now than I was a month ago, but my recommendation is to pass on this product unless you own and can operate power tools!

15239	__label2__	2	N	Office Products	B00CRJD7GQ	Smead Stick-N-Find Bluetooth Location Tracker with Key Fob, 2 per Pack (02218)	Needs work before it's useful	I bought a set of six of these via Kickstarter, and have had them since April.  The range is OK for indoor applications, if you want to spend $25 to track a $9 TV remote.  The range is really not good enough to go much further, unless you have line-of-sight (in which case, why use a tracker rather than your eyes?  Well, the leash function would be the answer - put a sticker on each of my bags, maybe on my coat, and if I walk off without the in an airport (or they walk off without me) then make my smartphone alert me.  That would be the ideal application.  The trouble is that for the leash (or other) functions of the software to work... the app must be active in the foreground of the smartphone, which also has to be awake.  Thus to have these track my bags I have to watch the iPhone and keep tickling it to stay awake (and not use it for other things).  If I want to have to watch something every moment, I may as well watch my bags rather than an app that watches my bags...  If they can fix the app so it works in the background then these would be useful.  Until then, not so much.

It does have netflix, huluplus, and amazon prime, which are the main things I use anyway so it does alright for me. The quality of 1080p streaming video on netflix and amazon is excellent.

4851	__label1__	5	N	Books	0755300203	The Jester	A Thriller about a Different Time and Place	Hugh De Luc is a French innkeeper in Eleventh Century France. He has a lovely wife, Sophie and is best known both for his bright red hair and his power to make people laugh. However he's got a conscience and he's haunted by the atrocities being done to Christians by the Turkish Pagans at Antioch.<br /><br />So when a rag tag group on their way to join the Crusades passes through his village, Hugh takes up the cause and leaves his wife and home to join the Crusaders. However he suffers miserably on the way to the Holy Land and the war disillusions him, so he deserts and heads home. When he gets back, he finds his inn has been burned to the ground, and his wife has been abducted by riders in black.<br /><br />Hugh believes she is being held by the liege Lord Baldwin, but can't find a way to save her. Then he gets idea of passing himself off as a Jester to get into Baldwin's inner circle and he augments his jokes with juggling and acrobatics and sets out to laugh and jest his way into the company of his enemies.<br /><br />Meanwhile Hugh is being hunted. Someone has been mercilessly looking for him for more than a year before he returned home, desperately wanting something of tremendous value he's brought back from the Holy Land. So, how did he become the most wanted man in Christendom? Not even Hugh knows. The mission to capture him and retrieve whatever it is he's supposed to have is a mystery to him.<br /><br />This is an excellent story with twists and turns a plenty. Eleventh Century France is made real by the author's vivid action and well written description. I found that I couldn't wait to see what happened next, what new secret would be unveiled in this wonderful book that transported me to a different time and place, making me forget all about the cares and worries of today.

I have a black and white kitchen with red accents and I thought the TV would fit right in but ,in actuality , the footprint of the TV is really too big  and looks sort of clunky and the silver plastic legs look a little tacky. There is a hand-hold in the top to make moving it easier.<br /><br />Function:<br /><br />I had never heard of the Seiki brand. I guess I'm a Sony, LG, Samsung snob when it comes to electronics.  The TV was easy to set up ,with on-screen directions ,and the picture really isn't that bad. It just doesn't seem that good for 1080p.  Because of the fixed angle of the screen the off-axis viewing isn't very good.  It has a plethora of connections but no headset connection.  The Yamaha sub-woofer gives better than normal sound for a small set.  Save your order number and Amazon offers thirty days phone support setting up your TV.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />If you're looking for a decorating fashion statement, conversation piece this might be the TV for you. If you're looking for a small TV (with headset connection) for your kitchen ,kids room or dorm room  you  might want to keep looking.<br /><br />note: After re-reading this review I can see I didn't add much helpful information for the TV but everything has been so competently and completely covered I don't know what I could have added.  It would have been helpful it there was a back view of the TV on the product page, showing all the connections, but I'm here to review the TV not the advertising method.

10574	__label2__	5	Y	Beauty	B000ELP5KA	Now Foods: Tea Tree Oil, 4 oz	Healed my acne!	This is the best natural product I've used on my skin. I made a DIY face wash which combines raw honey, coconut oil, aloe, and tea tree oil. The tea tree oil alone is too strong to put all over my face because i have seborrhea dermatitis around my nose. However, the cooling properties of aloe and honey allow me to rub the combined face wash all over my face without being too harsh. I noticed significant results in about 4 days, no more cystic acne...now to heal the blemishes.

15316	__label2__	4	Y	Musical Instruments	B009UEBUZQ	iMBAPrice iMBA-PS-12MF 12-Feet Gold Plated 3.5mm Male to 3.5mm Female Extension Stereo Audio Cable	Best bang for your buck for headphone extenders	I've previously had a more expensive headphone extender from Best Buy, but it by default wasn't the 3.5mm size. Instead, it had these attachments you would put on it so you can use it with 3.5mm's. The sound would cut in and out and you would have to find &#34;just the right spot&#34; with twisting the cord around at its different connection spots to keep the sound clear. It was a royal pain.<br /><br />This one works perfectly. My only qualm is it doesn't have any way to retract the length when you do not need the full 12 feet. There's plenty of workarounds for this anyways, it just would have been a nice feature to add.
11451	__label2__	3	Y	Musical Instruments	B00903HPQ0	You Rock Guitar YRG-1000 < Gen2 >	For me, better than a guitar, but...	I've changed from 5 stars to 3.<br /><br />Pros: I like almost everything about this. The musical accompaniment is sweet, helps with practice to keep in time and key. So many presets, likely several will be good for anyone's individual tastes.<br /><br />Cons: It's not a guitar, so think of it as the unique device that it is, and you'll be happy with it. The muting bar at the base of the strings doesn't always work, although I'm sure this can be tweaked.<br />Batteries: about 5 hours of playing time for each 4 AA battery set. Seems a bit expensive. They could have made it use much less juice by auto-light dimming. Engineers can't foresee everything...<br /><br />Construction: I think 10:1 this is built in China. Oh... where to begin. The first one I had was with major issues. The CPU somehow was not operating, or the control board, and the device would reset during play, or not stay on one preset. Amazon was good enough to send me another one. Alas, this one has issues too. The whammy bar is a bit wobbly, and it can easily be activated even when it is not desired. I know this because the last one had a whammy bar you could set perpendicular to the device, and it would not activate at all. I'm debating whether to take it off permanently, or just return the device and forget about it. That said, I love the idea behind this device, it is an ideal. Although their manufacturing process seems to have quality issues. You might get one that has no issues. If you do, I'm happy for you.

Also the ""diamonds"" in the middle do a great job of holding the item in the middle where you want.  We've not had it long enough to speak about durability, but it feels nice, strong and solid.

After a bit of fussing around and learning how they work we got them hooked up and functioning well.  The two things that were a bit of a challenge were scanning for channels, removing the ones we do not want or do not come in well --and-- preventing the device from shutting off after four hours.  After these two issues were solved they are performing great.  The only other thing was one of the devices had a broken RG-6 cable but that was easily fixed.  If you want an inexpensive digital to analog convert to get you by until the older tv is replaced this is well worth the consideration."

I bought it to go with my [[ASIN:B004WLJANQ Rachael Ray Teakettles 2-Quart Porcelain Curve Kettle, Orange]] and EVOO dispensers. The entire ladle is textured and slightly rough to the touch. The bowl holds 4 oz of liquid and is sufficiently wide for scooping up large chunks of stew. A hole at the top of the handle lets you hang it.<br /><br />This is the best ladle I've ever owned.

The bag came in a large box so I thought this was good as it should have protected it from being smashed, WRONG!<br />The bag was laid down on a table I use for charcoal and I slice down the middle to grab pieces instead of digging thru bag.<br />90 percent of the 40 lb. bag was small pieces...  Maybe 5 to 7 good size pieces. When loading up my chimney fire starter the pieces were actually falling thru the bottom. So you know they were small.<br />The aroma was good and non sparking but when I placed this order I also got the Fogo.<br />Go with the Fogo,  much better pieces and a better built bag.

10996	__label2__	4	N	Wireless	B00NM9OC46	Belkin Classic Case / Folio for iPhone 6 / 6S (Blacktop)	Nice and functional folio case	This is a nice folio type case for the iPhone 6. The matte cover has a smooth, rubberized and non-slippery feel to it. The iPhone is securely snapped in a built-in plastic cradle inside. The ring/silent switch, volume buttons, headphone jack and lightning connector are fully exposed, which means any third party lightning cable with a bigger connector should be able to plug in without obstruction. The interior of the front cover has a slot for storing a couple of credit cards and driver license (any more cards would make it uneven and too bulky).<br /><br />Another great feature is that the folio case can be converted into a stand for the iPhone (in landscape mode). The back cover folds back a little for the phone cradle to stand on the interior of the front cover. It works pretty well when you want to watch a video clip or use video chatting. In addition, the back has a nice, clean oval cutout for the rear camera and flash.<br /><br />I like this folio case for the added protection against drops since the phone cradle is recessed from the outer edges of the folio covers. The extra margin helps absorb impact from a drop. On the other hand, this makes the case slightly longer and wider than the iPhone. It in turn makes an already large, hard-to-pocket iPhone 6 even harder to put in a pocket.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sleek, great looking folio case. I really like the simplicity design with a slot for a credit card and driver license (which are probably what you'll need to carry with you for most days), and that it can double up as a stand for easy viewing on a table. It also protects the large touchscreen well with its cover. It may not be truly pocketable, but it certainly protects the iPhone well.

10839	__label2__	4	N	Books	0803738552	Counting by 7s	A beautiful story - a no spoilers review	This is one of the most beautiful stories I've read in a long time. It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among.<br /><br />This book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards.<br /><br />That said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks. This is a book to savor and to relish, not to grip with white knuckled fingers at 2am.<br /><br />But personally for me, an adult, I was enchanted by it and am glad to have read it.<br /><br />P.S I know I mentioned the death but since the product description mentions it, I didn't consider it a spoiler.

If you're an intelligent reader who is looking for an smart, provocative, impressive mystery that will teach you many things as you read, this is the book for you.

11185	__label2__	5	N	Baby	B00A3R0EOC	Peg Perego Book Plus, Pois Black	Pois Black is hard to see in the dark - pick a brighter color.	.<br />4.5 Stars out of 5<br /><br />I am amazed at the sophistication of this stroller.  It is NOT the same animal as the under $100 varieties and in ten years it will still be a beautiful, fully loaded, functional work of art.  If your budget can absorb the sticker shock associated with this stroller, you'll be hard pressed to find something more versatile or better constructed.  I'm going to start with what I think of as the negatives aspects as there fewer of them than positives.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*  Price - of course.<br />*  The Pois Black stroller is hard to see in the dark.  You'll trip over it at night and it makes me nervous to walk the neighborhood at dawn and dusk.<br />*  There may be too many features.  It easily becomes overwhelming to try to understand how to use them all.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*  High quality construction with premium materials.<br />*  Extremely versatile and will continue to offer functionality and beneficial features as your baby grows.<br />*  Fairly lightweight and easy to stow into the back of the car.<br />*  You can get the baby seat from the same manufacturer and it will snap securely onto the frame.  Here's Amazon's listing:  [[ASIN:B004DIOY8Y Peg-Perego Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat, Myrto]]<br />*  Front or rear facing functionality with a peek portal.<br />*  Plenty of onboard storage.<br />*  Water bottle holder.<br />*  Adjustable handle to easily accommodate taller as well as shorter people.<br />*  Turns on a dime - great for elevators and shopping aisles.<br />*  The rear wheels lock to help keep the stroller from creeping away from you.<br />*  Easy to clean materials.<br />*  Beautifully designed and attractive.<br /><br />There are so many other features and positive things I could say about this stroller, but I think I've gotten my point across.  I did not choose the color I received and as my only real negative, I would caution parents to select one that has bright visible colors on it.  We have tripped over this stroller in the darkness of the house (insert not-baby-friendly expletives here for stubbed toes).  I also don't feel it is visible enough for strolling the neighborhood in lower light conditions.  Add a glow-in-the-dark doo-dad here and there and you've just solved this problem.<br /><br />I have to admit that I still don't know how to quickly use every feature of this stroller.  When in doubt, I refer to the video on this page.  I've watched it at least a dozen times by now and I have it bookmarked for easy reference.<br /><br />Enjoy, and congratulations!  This Grammy is beyond delighted!

6861	__label1__	5	N	Sports	B00H1E0L3Y	"Kinesiology TAPE + 2"" x 16.4' Roll in Black: Increase Your Performance with Supersticky Waterproof tape for knee, shoulder, ankle, calf injuries - Money Back Guarantee: the best physio / kinetic tape for athletes available - Bonus: Tutorial Videos"	It Really Sticks!	When I came across kinesiology tapes, I felt right away that they might just do the trick.  I wanted to see if they would support my muscles & tendons and also what it would do for my ache & pain areas, especially my lower leg muscles.  I stay very active, but as I am quickly moving into my middle age, my body does not recuperate as quickly as in my younger years.<br /><br />Fortunately for me and my clients, as an experienced personal health/fitness trainer/consultant (path2fit.com), I looked methodically into kinesiology or kinesio tapes to see if it actually worked or was just hype. And as anyone who knows me can tell you, I test something very carefully before recommending it.<br /><br />I compared Kinesiology TAPE + to a few other top brands that are on the market.  My methodology was to put Kinesiology TAPE + on one calf (where I was experiencing over tightness and spasms after workouts) and a competing brand on the other. I then switched the competing brand to another brand after a few days.  What I found is that Kinesiology TAPE + is as stretchy, super-sticky, water/grease proof as it claims.  I actually put it on right after one of my work outs when I was sweaty & oily, as most of us are after a good work out session.  I was surprised that it not only stayed on but it even lasted at least a week through workouts and showers.<br /><br />Instantly, when applied, I did not even feel my injured areas.  That allowed me to continue my exercise routine when I was sure I would have to rest or alter the routine drastically for a few days till I improved.  When it naturally came off, which was a lot longer than I anticipated, it had helped to heal the sensitive area with no allergic reaction on my skin whatsoever.<br /><br />The other brands, even though they had a somewhat similar effect, did not feel as good or last as long as the Kinesiology TAPE +.  And some left sticky, hard-to-remove glue trace after they came off.  Kinesiology TAPE + did not.<br /><br />I do recommend to follow the instructions of cutting the edges in a slightly rounded shape so it will stay on longer.<br /><br />Another thing that I like about Kinesiology TAPE + is that we don't have to be medical professionals to be able to apply & use the Kinesiology TAPE +.  Instructions come in YouTube videos that assist us in applying the Kinesiology TAPE + to the areas in our body that need extra TLC.<br /><br />The almost magical Kinesiology TAPE + has helped me not only keep my exercise routine going but has aided me in healing the inflamed & sore areas in my body including my lower leg muscles.

The toner cartridge I received was an ""Office Depot"" brand reconditioned toner cartridge and not anything connected to HP as the manufacturer.<br /><br />If I wanted a refilled used laser toner cartridge I would have bought one and at a much lower cost than this one is selling at - hence my surprise to see I was sent a refilled cartridge."

17559	__label2__	4	Y	Baby	B00IANUYSC	Infantino Fusion Flexible Position Baby Carrier, Grey	Love the versatility	This carrier has been great. There are three main things I love about it.<br /><br />1. It was a waist belt. A lot of carriers that can have the baby front facing only have the shoulder straps. Those kill your back after a while. I can hold my 20 pound baby for quite a while with no back pain.<br /><br />2. It's really easy to adjust. My husband and I both use this product quite often. My husband is about 8 in. taller than me, so this is a must for us. Not only is it easy to adjust, it's pretty quick too.<br /><br />3. There are several carrying positions. There are 4 to be exact. Facing you narrow seat, facing you wide seat, facing out, and backpack. The facing you narrow seat is great when the baby is too small to wrap their legs around you. This is a problem with most ergonomic baby carriers. Then when the baby is big enough, you can use the facing you wide seat, which is the safest position for babies in carriers-especially for longer periods of time. Facing out is great when baby can hold their head up and want to explore. I haven't used the backpack carry yet, but I imagine that will be very helpful as my baby grows.<br /><br />There's only one drawback in this carrier. It's hard to change from the wide seat to the narrow seat. It's very hard to get the toggles and buttons through the holes. This may just be to keep the carrier more secure though, so it may be a good thing.<br /><br />It's a great carrier. I'd recommend it to anyone.

But they are not even jumbo at all. They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos. So several look like they have had an operation, and split entirely apart and melted back together. But, what do you expect from anything now days that has 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. Overall, I'll rate these 3 stars, and lucky they get that. Would not recommend to toddlers, but only kids 5 and up, and expect them to cry when they get 4 exact duplicate dinosaurs.

So 3 years ago we bought a nice S&F mattress, which had the support, but was too firm on the pressure points. A topper from BBB worked for a couple years, but then it must have worn out and she was getting a lot of pain again. So we tried out a number of different options, including a SN bed, a gel memory foam, this one, and a poly fill topper. The SN bed was a glorified air mattress, which did not help at all and cost as much as our king sized bedroom set. The gel memory foam did not make it out of the package, since the memory foams hadn't worked in the past. The latex was okay at first, but she didn't love it and wanted to try another one. The poly fill topper felt great at first (&#34;like a cloud&#34;), but was compressed by morning and the aches were back. At this point, we gave the latex another shot and after a week, realized that her back pain was gone!<br /><br />While I'm not picky about what I sleep on, I love the latex too. While the cost is higher than some other options, it has the perfect combination of comfort and support (and is much cheaper than a new bed). Summer is just getting started, but so far it has been as cool as anything else. The quality of this topper is the best I have seen, with a cover that makes it simple to install and rotate. The straps on the cover have no issues fitting over our extra deep mattress. A note on size: it does not extend the full dimensions of the bed, but leaves ~1&#34; all around to help the sheets fit.<br /><br />Customer service and communication from the seller is top notch. I had a minor issue when we received it, and they settled it immediately. Thanks!

The button has a variable intensity that works well, and it's small enough to get in tight spots.  And I knew it wouldn't be super-powerful with just 12volts, and I was right.  Larger bolts won't budge with the Hitachi.  Lug nuts? Fuggetaboutit.  My buddy's 18v Milwaukee leaves me jealous.  I guess that will need to go on my Christmas list.<br /><br />So, bottom line is it's a top quality tool for light work, but lug nuts and the like are out of the question.

He loves it.<br /><br />First: It's well-packaged and arrived in perfect condition.  Big numbers/letters, & easy to read, even from a distance in a bright or dark room.  Easy to set up (it comes pre-set to EST).<br /><br />That said, since it includes the day & date, it should also be able to determine if daylight savings time is in effect - especially for its whopping price!  I also took back a star for not putting any information on the rear button controls.

10880	__label2__	5	Y	Tools	B004M8R9W8	Milwaukee 2615-20 Cordless M18 Right Angle Drill, Tool only	excellent drill for tight applications	I've found all of my Milwaukee tools to be consistently sturdy and reliable and this is no exception.  The torque on this drill is obvious when you use it the first time.  this has a dial clutch actuator, so you can choose any torque limit you wish - and the lowest torque setting is a good place to start with small screws! When the drill reaches the torque setting, the drill stops. This drill is well-designed and well-engineered.  It is ideal for tight quarters.<br /><br />The LED is bright and illuminates the workspace well.  When maximum torque is achieved the LED changes to red when the drill stops.  Nice feature.<br /><br />The advantage of the bare tool is that you don't have to buy additional batteries and chargers.  It does not come in a plastic box - which would have been a nice addition.  It uses the new M-18 batteries.<br /><br />Great drill.  Recommended.

I use a tote to hold several items I need available for work each day.  As I work at different locations, the tote stays in the cargo area of my mini-van most of the time. The tote frequently slides around - this seemed like the perfect solution to keep it in place.  Unfortunately, the velcro on the bottom does not work with the low pile, smooth carpet in my van.  The Stayhold pieces slide around, just like the tote does, rather than gripping into place.  I think the product would work with higher pile carpets, but it doesn't work for me. I am sadly returning the Stayhold and will look for a different solution.

5304	__label1__	5	N	PC	B00SFVII0U	Mediabridge Carrying Case For Portable External Hard Drive - Fits WD My Passport Ultra & Toshiba Canvio Basics	Like rabbits, they seem to multiply over time	&#34;Vine Customer Review of Free Product (What's this?)<br /><br />My friend has one of these:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B003LSTD38<br /><br />We all have external portable hard drives. Most of us have several of them. Like rabbits, they seem to multiply over time. And they get larger--much larger. What was 250 GB the day before yesterday was 500 GB yesterday and a terabyte today. The more they hold, the more we stand to lose if they are dropped and the data is not backed up elsewhere.<br /><br />Sadly, the portable drives that carry around our prized possessions (photos, music, videos, data files, etc.) often go unprotected. (True, some portable hard drives come with cases of sorts--but, really, how good is their protection?) And consider how many portable drives we purchase that come with no case at all. Nothing to protect that which is protecting our valuable data. How can this be allowed?<br /><br />Apparently, the folks at Amazon have recognized this shortcoming and have offered us a solution in the AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Case for My Passport Essential. The case feels rugged enough and while it doesn't offer a great deal of padding, the webbing and elastic drive strap inside may help in the event of a few minors falls. The case has a stiff outer shell that may provide some additional protection. Most importantly, you have something to keep your portable drive housed in while it is not in use.<br /><br />Although they do vary a bit in size and shape, most modern portable drives seem close to being the same form factor. That led me to wonder why Amazon singled out the Passport Essential Drive for this case. Was it some cross advertising deal with Western Digital? Was it that they plan to offer an entire line of AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Cases each intended for a specific manufacture's model? So, in the interest of science, I conducted an experiment to see what other portable drives might fit in this case.

I normally worry about my luggage being overweight because I always over pack. Not this trip - I actually had room to spare for gifts to bring home - not to mention ten pounds to play with because the luggage is so lightweight..
18813	__label2__	5	Y	Toys	B004PXOKG8	Educo Season's Best Fresh Market Vegetables	Great addition to my daughters play kitchen	"I wanted something for my 2 year old to have in her play kitchen that was not ""junk food"" related. As a fussy eater, I've read it's key to have them get interested in food by having them involved in the meal prep and choosing of the meal.  I thought it might be a good idea to have her playing with fruits and vegetables too.  I got this set and she's in love.  At her age she needs some help lining up the knife to cut but she can cut through it just fine.  It's so much fun.  The sound is great and it really works.  I just ordered the fruit set too.  No word yet if it influences her desire to eat healthy foods...but this is a nicely made, charming set that will help with dexterity to boot.  Not a piece of crud like a lot of the cheap items you see.  Worth every penny."

You wouldn't be ashamed to show it the video to your friends. The photos came out really good, too. This camera definitely change my first impression about it.‏

7791	__label1__	5	N	Sports	B00HV0NPVS	nU Groove Sharpener - Golf Club Groove Sharpener, Re-Grooving Tool and Cleaner.	Great groove sharpener!!!	I purchased the nU Groove Sharpener last week from the company website and sat down to regroove my Titleist Vokey Spin MIlled wedges. I have had the wedges since 2009 and was deciding between buying new SM4s or trying the nU Groove Sharpener to restore the grooves. Spending over $300 to replace 3 of my wedges or $13 and minimal effort on my part, it was a no brainer.  After following the instructions provided and watching the video on their website, my vokeys' grooves are back to like new. Overall, it took about 20 minutes to do the 3 wedges. The nU Groove Sharpener was easy to use and will be a great addition in my bag for cleaning the grooves on the course.

18226	__label2__	5	Y	Shoes	B00HCID8IE	Dr. Martens Tully Mary Jane (Toddler),Black Softy T,6 UK(7 M US Toddler)	A great, fantastic leather shoe - and what teen of the 90s doesn't want Docs for her kid!	Pros -<br />Leather: Really great quality leather. It will scuff, but it polishes up really well. Don't feel any pressure to polish your kids shoes - but it really is an easy thing to do if you want to clean them up a bit (I did for school pictures)<br />Sole: Oh my, if your toddler likes to climb up things like slides (instead of going down) then these shoes have great grip.<br />Water: This is not a boot, so don't let your kid go jumping in puddles - but the leather isn't going to soak through and be wet.<br /><br />Cons -<br />This one isn't fair because they ARE Docs... The shoe has a bigger profile than a typical mary janes and doesn't &#34;dress up&#34; as well. So, I would advise that this shoe is not suitable as a dress up shoe.

It takes a while to develop and ear for tuning a guitar, but finally a cheap solution to help you! After buying one of these tuners with a guitar I bought recently, I was pleased to be able to easily tune my own guitar. I then bought one to my 13 year old daughter who is learning to play, and now she can tune her own guitar after her little brothers mess up the tuning. The piece clips onto the end of the neck of the guitar, in between the knobs. All you have to do is pluck a string and the tuner quickly identifies which string and tells you whether the string is sharp or flat or perfect. Great little tuner and very accurate!

However, it's a 'Type 27' which was already included in the DeWalt angle grinder kit. I will probably be returning it to Amazon since I really don't need it.    It would be helpful to specifically state in the description that it's a 'Type 27' Guard and NOT a 'Type 1'. The description states: ""Compatible with the following models: ...D28402K (Type 1) 4-1/2 Small Angle Ginder...""    Also, the photograph only shows the top section of the guard which isn't helpful since BOTH types appear the same from this angle.

20307	__label2__	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B008KECFRO	Sony BRAVIA KDL42EX440 42-Inch 1080p LED HDTV (Black)	Great TV... Beware of ordering from Amazon	We wanted a TV that had a nice picture for a nice price.  We've been pleased with our current Sony TV, just needed one a little larger.  We ordered the first TV and the box and TV arrived damaged.  We figured this was just a fluke so we returned that one and ordered another TV.  The second arrived more damaged than the first... all the Styrofoam corners were smashed and the box had been punctured at the bottom, breaking the area of the TV where the stand sits.  We returned that one and went to a B&M retailer to purchase the TV.  It appears that the damage is occurring in Amazon's warehouse before being sent to the customer, as both times the box appeared to be punctured by a forklift and then re-taped over that area.<br /><br />I highly recommend the TV, just purchase it from somewhere other than Amazon!

10874	__label2__	5	N	Beauty	B001E722ZY	Nature's Gate Natural Toothpaste, Creme de Peppermint, 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 6)	The best toothpaste I've ever used, hands down	I tried about 30 different toothpastes before finding this one. It's by far my favorite. It's minty with a bite that I can feel.<br /><br />I ditched the major commercial toothpastes because they contained a lot of chemicals and additives like colorants and artificial sweeteners. I hated Tom's of Maine because of their metal tubes. Hard to squeeze all of it out once it starts emptying out and sometimes the tube would puncture, leaking toothpaste everywhere.<br /><br />Dessert Essence I also didn't like. The one I bought was sweetened with stevia and had a very unpleasant strong after taste.<br /><br />Nature's Gate also makes a toothpaste gel one that tastes really bad. Get this one!

12714	__label2__	4	N	PC	B006L6ZSWC	Corsair Obsidian Series Black 550D Mid Tower Computer Case	Good Case!	I replaced a Corsair 500R with this case and I'm glad I did. I originally replaced the 500R because it just felt cheaply made and it wasn't that great to build in. The 550D has a very solid build quality and I haven't had a single issue with it since I bought it around 6 months or so ago.<br /><br />I love the magnetic dust filters on the side and top of the case and they do a very good job catching most of the dust and keeping the inside of your case relatively dust free. The bottom dust filter is good but mine has started to bend a little causing it to be slightly warped at the back of the case. Although the dust filters work great they are stating to get hard to clean. No matter if I spray them with air or wash them in the sink they still look dusty all the time. It doesn't effect them working but it does make your computer look dirty all the time.<br /><br />The cable management is pretty good on this case but I would have like more places to tie cables down on the top behind the motherboard tray. I also would've liked if the motherboard tray was raised slightly more in order to run cables behind the motherboard better. I was only able to run 4 cables behind the motherboard before there just wasn't anymore space and I couldn't screw the motherboard down. I would fully recommend getting a fully modular power supply to make building in the 550D easier. You may have issues getting the back door to fully close with all the extra connectors you're not using.<br /><br />I know all Corsair cases are made for the H100 cooler but I had a hell of a time installing the H100 in this case. The problem I had was there was barely enough space at the top between the motherboard and the radiator to clear my motherboard power connector. So right now the fans on the H100 are sitting right on top of my power connector pushing it down slightly. Other people may not have the same issue depending on where the connector sits on their motherboard. If you have one on the top of your motherboard be warned that it will be a tight fit.<br /><br />Lastly the main reason why people will buy this case, the sound dampening foam. In my experience, it doesn't do much of anything to quiet your computer down. I've tried with the side and top panels off and on and I noticed no difference in sound but obviously a lot higher temperatures with the panels on. The main reason I think it doesn't work is the foam is way too thin in order to stop enough sound to notice a difference. I feel as though they should just remove the foam all together from the 550D and sell it for a little cheaper.<br /><br />Overall the 550D is a very nice case once you look past the few annoyances it has. I've owned several cases before buying this one and so far this has been the best case I owned. I think for its price point Corsair makes some of the best looking and best made cases around. There's little doubt in my mind I'd ever consider buying another brand of case in the future unless other companies really step their game up as far as build quality.

I am a frequent traveler so I really only use an eye mask when I'm on a plane and trying to get some rest. I hate it when the person next to me has their light on and I'm trying to sleep! So I saw the great reviews for this eye mask and thought I'd try it out. I went to Rome last month and used it for the flight over and had a really good rest. It could also be that I tried out this new product I found [[ASIN:B00JRMNVRG JetFighter Sleep - Jet Lag Relief - Fights Jet Lag Symptoms Like Sleeplessness and Disturbed Sleep - 30 Sleep Aid Pills - Non Homeopathic - Contains Melatonin - Made in the USA]] which knocked me right out. Anyway, they work really well together. The mask drowned out all of the light and was comfortable enough to wear for the entire 9 hour flight. The material is really comfortable and the band in the back wasn't too restrictive. Overall I am very pleased with my eye mask and would definitely recommend it to others.

20577	__label2__	4	N	Books	0345547357	Power Score: Your Formula for Leadership Success	What Is Your Score?	So what is your Power Score?<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 10 how well have you laid out the priorities of your organization and is everyone on board with them and for them.<br /><br />Multiply that number by<br /><br />One a scale of 1 to 10 on what percentage of people in your organization are “A players”?  0% to 100%.  These are people who are in the right job and contribute positively to the organizations culture.<br /><br />Then multiply that number by the condition of your organizations relationship.  Relationships between employees, between management and labor, between the organization and its customers and suppliers.<br /><br />The perfect number you can have is 1000, but that is probably impossible.  A number of 729 means you are running at full power.  500 to 700 means you are doing pretty well.  Below 500 you need to do some work.<br /><br />That is the premise of the Power Score.  The book is written in a question and answer format, the authors asking the questions they believe the reader would ask and then answering them.  It actually makes for an easy read and makes it easy to explain some of their more complex thoughts.  Overall there is nothing earth shattering in this book, it all comes down to basic common business sense, the authors just organize it in very thoughtful way, and they support all of their claims with references a large pool of research they are pulling from.  They offer ideas and strategies to improve your score in all three of the categories.<br /><br />So I don’t think this book offers any earth shattering ideas, it is full of a lot of good ones.  Worth a read if you are in a position to alter your organization for the better.

645	__label1__	1	N	Camera	B00008Y0VN	Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter	hard focus and objects that you view are fuzzy...	I had high hopes when I ordered this set of binoculars. I recently read reviews and saw mostly positive ones, so I decided to get one for myself. Once I got them I noticed a hard focus - I couldn't set a proper distance, one which would be proper for my eyesight and binoculars. The more troubling problem was that there was some scratch inside the optics, so every object around me looked fuzzy. This was really a hard disappointing experience for me, so I asked for a refund.<br /><br />However I bought a Bushnell Binoculars (http://amzn.to/13xDW5q), because of a friendly suggestion. There were more practical and the fact that they are waterproof really changed my ways of using binoculars :).
20764	__label2__	2	Y	Apparel	B00KZFYMLI	NYDJ Women's Sheri Skinny Jeans in Modesto, Modesto, 14	Order much smaller than you usually do!	A warning to all, size down at least 1 size, OK, 2 sizes.  The flattening panel in the front needs to fit you like a girdle and when it doesn't, there are pooches on both sides of it, and you, at the tummy.  Washing and drying on a hot setting doesn't do much, NYDJ recommends cold water. Washing in hot just relaxes the spandex and the shrinkage is just temporary from the cotton shrinking. I was also disappointed that they were NOT Skinny. Slim, yes, but not what I expected.  I couldn't return them because the return policy states that you can't open the package to try them on, and expect to return them. The one good thing is that NYDJ positions the back pockets closer together and this is more flattering on your rear. If the prices weren't so darn high, I would order the leggings, but not having a good experience the first time, I'll pass.  Too bad, I was excited to look great in them.

9007	__label1__	5	Y	Video DVD	B00H9KKKAY	The Wolf of Wall Street (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD)	The Perfect Wolf	by Bill Chambers Paramount brings The Wolf of Wall Street home in a bare-bones release that, as anticipated by all but a few chumps, does not contain any deleted scenes or additional footage incorporated into the body of the film. I'm sure Hell will freeze over before Scorsese restores this or Gangs of New York to their original length, though his availing deleted scenes to the public is not unprecedented, as the Cape Fear DVD and Blu-ray demonstrate, so maybe we haven't seen the last of this movie yet. At least the dearth of frills grants the 2.40:1, 1080p transfer of the film itself a generous 42GB berth, and the resulting image is above reproach. Practically a Star Wars prequel in its use of digitally-generated environments, and shot in a mix of Super35--sometimes with anamorphic lenses, for the focal distortions--and HD (the ARRI Alexa was reserved for low-light and greenscreen-heavy shots) by Argo DP Rodrigo Prieto, The Wolf of Wall Street nonetheless boasts a cohesive, credible, and cinematic Blu-ray presentation with glassy detail and supple dynamic range. Grain is extremely subtle, but any noise-reduction was surely done at the intermediate stage rather than after the fact, while an emphatic ruddiness to the skin tones seems to be a Scorsese signature of late (see: Shutter Island). Other than size, this is an insignificant downgrade from a DCP screening. The attendant 5.1 DTS-HD MA track is a 360° wall of sound whenever the offices of Stratton Oakmont erupt in mayhem, although dialogue is always very clear above the fray, including much throwaway ADR. Song reproduction, critical to a Scorsese mix-tape such as this, is excellent, crisp and full.<br /><br />Perfect I think they could cut running time down by half hour.<br />The time flew by watching this movie!

I enjoy using looms myself. I'm in my 30s and I truly have a good time creating looms accessories.  Of course I go for more advanced and complicated design.  I fill orders for some organizations and make a little money on the side. But i really just enjoy making accessories.<br /><br />Infinity looms is not a well advertised brand but it really should be out there on the tv and magazines.  I find the quality of the bands to be really good. The bands have bright colors, and you get a  lot of colors in the deluxe kit.  The bands are soft, odorless, the have a good stretch which makes it easier for me to do complex designs.  The hooks are alright.  I do prefer s-clips over c-clips.  The loom itself is really good.  It's sturdy and not flimsy.  You can extend the looms to any length just keep attaching more looms.<br /><br />As far as i'm concerned with the many brands I've tried for looms, Inifity loom bands are on top.  Please try it out yourself and I'm sure you will also notice the difference.

With this version of the silver needles variety it makes it easy to have a nice and light cup of tea anytime you want. It is very easy to brew and this brand also allows you the ability to get several brews or steepings out of each of the leaves. That helps to make it very economical.<br /><br />For those times when I feel like splurging a bit, I tend to go with something like this: [[ASIN:B00HFMS74C Organic Black Loose Leaf Tea: Earl Grey Creme 4 oz. + FREE Bamboo Tea Strainer]]<br /><br />Earl Grey creme has a strong and refreshing full-bodied flavor. You can even tell this just from the smell. Many people consider it to be a perfect breakfast tea. While I don't disagree, it is also great in the evening. Like I said, this is a variety that can really give your normal tea routine a little change-up.

10767	__label2__	3	N	Beauty	B00AE078YM	Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes, Color and Damage Repair, 3.5 Fl Oz	Some improvement	"I was actually surprised to see some results at the very end of this treatment.  I don't wash my hair every day so I used these tubes for 7 consecutive washes.  I didn't notice much difference during the first 5 tubes, in fact, my hair felt heavy and with some residue.  My hair is wavy but med/thin and it weighs down easily.  By the 6th and 7th tubes, I notice my hair was a bit bouncier and the frizz control had improved.  I didn't see a dramatic change, like super silky or shiny, but I did notice the almost no frizz - and we have had rainy days, so I know it helped.<br /><br />My hair is brown with some highlights.  This treatment didn't make the highlights dull or fade away (like other heavy treatments have done).  I didn't use a special shampoo, just used this treatment instead of conditioner (with longer waiting time).  I didn't use any other styling products either.  Each tube has plenty of `cream' and I wonder if a person with short hair would be able to use half the tube at a time.  My hair is about 3"" below my shoulders now, and I could've used 2/3 of the tube and have plenty.<br /><br />Overall, the 7 'day' treatment improved my hair but didn't change it dramatically."

11566	__label2__	5	N	Luggage	B00PVPD6TQ	Rockland Jr. My First Backpack, Owl, One Size	Sturdy construction, charming design	This may be a small backpack, but it's made of the same quality standards as the larger versions. The backpack has a semi-firm padding on the back panel to give cushion between books and the back. The zippers are well made and firmly situated in the backpack. The zipper pulls, which look like little pencils, are thick rubber - easy to pull and they don't get too hot or too cold to the touch when there are weather extremes. My only criticism is that the bottom of the backpack has zero padding. This means that books or electronics will get damaged over time every time this bag is put on the ground. Rolling up a washcloth on the bottom helps, but it can shift around and built-in padding would have been preferred. Our youngest granddaughter is in love with owls and obsessed with waltzing around the house with her big sister's backpacks - so now she's got her very own. It fits her well and she is in love with it. There are two zippered compartments that are well lined. This is nicer than any backpack I had when I was in grade school - very well built.

I have had them now for about 2 1/2 years and they are great.<br /><br />My favorite feature is that they fold up and store away and they take up a lot less space in my garage. I used them today and it just reminded me that I needed to post a review on them. They are strong and easy to set up and tear down. It seems like every project I do I get them out and use them. I like them a lot and I rate them at 5 stars.

I was very satisfied with the look and build of this watch. It's very durable so far and I would highly recommend it. The watch looks like it cost much more and it goes great with many outfits.

17788	__label2__	4	Y	Home Entertainment	B0078LSTWU	Samsung UN32EH4003 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LED TV (2012 Model)	Great Bedroom TV	"This TV was a replacement for a 5-year-old, 26-inch ""flat screen"" LG TV for use in a bedroom.<br /><br />For starters, the TV's bezel is extremely narrow and the TV is MUCH thinner than our old TV.  Additionally, I was surprised how much lighter (at least 15 pounds) this TV is than the older LG.<br /><br />On to the important information... This TV's picture is beautiful!  I cannot over state this.  Samsung LED TV's are simply gorgeous, and this ""lower-end"" model is no different.  It's much better than the older TV and is similar to, or better than, our primary 55"" Samsung LED TV.  Colors are vibrant, whites are bright, and blacks are dark.  Setup out of the box took around 30 minutes--this included screwing the base to the TV and completing the simple, guided on-screen setup.<br /><br />The contested point, and what I was worried about:  the sound.  In my opinion (and more importantly the wife's!), the sound is perfectly fine for a bedroom TV.  And I'm sure it would be OK for a primary TV setup (although a soundbar would be MUCH better).  My only complaint about the sound is that there is little graduation between the low and high volume.  What do I mean?  To me the TV is quiet, and then it is LOUD!  There is little ""in between"" volume.  Other than that complaint, the sound is fine.<br /><br />Overall, this TV is a great buy.  It has an awesome picture, and is a perfect TV."
11140	__label2__	4	N	Books	193930900X	Gangsterland - Ink Portal Adventure #1	Very cool book!	I received a free copy through Goodreads First Reads.<br /><br />This book was just ok for me. But then I am not the target audience. It was will written and liked the concept, just not thrilling for me. So, to give it a better review I gave it to my nephew who is a 12 yr boy and very mush in the target audience. He really enjoyed it. He loved the comic book angle and found story thoroughly entertaining. He like the lead and thought it was great fun to read. So, I gave his star rating instead of mine!!

I don't always need these, but when I go out and especially since I am in a wheelchair, it is wonderful not ot have to worry about leaks....sometimes we just need a 'little help'.  These do the job, are comfortable and control odor.  Also, they keep you feeling dry without that 'damp' feeling if you leak a bit.  Wicks the moisture away from your body.  Helps prevent UTI's also.

14990	__label2__	3	Y	Tools	B004QXT0SU	Crews 207 Hard shell Crush Resistant Eyeglass Case with Belt Loop Hook, Black	Cheap, sturdy case with poor closing mechanism	Cheap, and fits my giant aviators.  Not many solid cases available for those types of glasses.<br /><br />Nothing really holds it closed.  It's just a groove in the plastic that it snaps on.  If you dropped this on pavement, it would open up and your glasses would take a tumble.  I admit I haven't tested this theory, but if you're looking for something to hang from a belt loop or the outside of your pack, this isn't it.  I keep it inside my backpack in a pocket that keeps it from opening, and it's been great in that capacity.<br /><br />So, the case is sturdy and very crush resistant, and good for tossing in your bag or car door, but the poor closing mechanism means you shouldn't expose it to situations where that might be an issue.

I was a little surprised  how small they were, but that was my fault for not reading. And i didnt know they came with divider cups, which are removable. I am the type to buy quality once, not OK twice or three times. so far all my tupperware is Lock and Lock, its been bumped, dropped, microwaved, washed in the dishwasher, you name it. I love this brand. The lids lock nice and snug, they dong leak and so far aren't twisting or staining, they have carried both taco sauce and spaghetti sauce number times. most people give tupperware a bad wrap for staining, but are usually the ones too lazy to rinse after use.

After several minutes of messing with it the sound turned on. It would take 10 minutes to an hour for the sound to start working. It also froze up often. I called samsung customer service twice. The first time the guy told me to unplug it and plug it back in and hung up.  The second time they had me reset it and it didn't work. So I decided to send it back to Amazon for a new one but they are out of stock. I wanted to exchange it for a different one at the same price that was sold by Amazon but it wouldn't let me for who knows what reason.

Very well made knife with great fit & finish .  Ergonomics are decent - not the best, but certainly not the worst, and for the price it's certainly nothing to complain about!  The blade is extremely robust and made from Japanese AUS8a stainless steel.  The knife however is made in Taiwan, but in my personal experience, I've found that blades made in Taiwan sport the same quality as USA made products.<br /><br />The only negative I can say about this knife is that it's on the heavy side for an EDC folder.  But otherwise, it's a great hard use folder for outdoors and self defense.  Amazing blade for $20  Recommended!

16328	__label2__	1	Y	Musical Instruments	B002VA464S	Blue Yeti USB Microphone - Silver	The Microphone worked for about 30 minutes -- then just stopped.	I got the microphone, it synced with my Mac immediately. I was using Audacity to record and it worked beautifully.... for about a half hour! After that, I hadn't even unplugged it, two of the settings no longer registered noise. The computer still registered that the microphone was plugged in. The stereo/bidirectional setting would work perfectly, then as soon as I changed it to the cardioid or omni setting, my voice did not register.<br />After two days of conversations with the Service Department at Blue Microphones, they said it was a faulty device and that I would have to pay for shipping back in order to get it resolved.<br />**Note that the company does not cover any shipping costs for product maintenance under their warranty.**<br />Be aware of that when planning to buy this equipment. It is highly frustrating as I live in Australia and would have to ship the product back to their Service Department in the US.<br />I will not be working with Blue Microphones in the future. I will say, however, that I loved the microphone for the half hour that it worked.<br /><br />Good luck!

20113	__label2__	3	Y	Watches	B00FZZ8PS4	Paylak TS-CH300 Metal Watch Repair Tool	Another Flawed Large Watch Case Holder	A while back I did a review on another watch case holder specifically aimed at the larger watch cases now are now becoming more common.  The one then was all aluminum and did an acceptable job of holding the case, but the pins were a very sloppy fit in the machined aluminum side pieces.  While the first one worked &#34;OK&#34;  I got tired of crawling around looking on the floor for the pins that had fallen out.  Still not satisfied that I had a decent solution to the large watch case problem, I ordered up the Paylak large case holder from Amazon.  It's made of some kind plastic, is fairly heavy--a good thing--and is a lot larger than the previous one I had gotten from Amazon.  However just like the other one, the pins fall out.  The one advantage of the Paylak case holder is that the pins have a flat side  and don't roll as far under the benches as the other does which is a lot like saying &#34;for such a fat kid, he doesn't sweat much&#34;.  In the early 21st century, it seem odd that such a simple problem has avoided solution.<br /><br />blues

The older children get involved in the logistics of it as well as in making things happen if it gets too calm. The younger ones just enjoy marching the cute little penguins around. There is plenty of room for creativity. A Zip-lock bag is going to come in handy. The game comes with 3 masts, a 2-piece water wave, and 16 ""Pirate Penguins"" all the same size and shape, a very nice size and shape to play with. I plan to give ours individual identities by putting initials or designs on their fronts in different colors. This is the kind of game that we seem to spend hours playing with together. I suspect the penguins will outlive the masts. Over time they may end up in a doll house occasionally. That's okay too. They're adorable."

We bought this and it was missing two support pieces, so we had to return it and get a better brand.  It's one thing to have your product made in China to save on costs, it's another to let your quality control go to zero: this company shipped out the box with several parts missing.  To add insult to injury they were closed when we called to ask for more.<br />Lousy company!

The camera is not great in low light but in all other ways the Olympus PEN E-PL1 12.3MP Live MOS Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens meets my very basic needs. The camera was cheap fun to use and easy on my wallet.  I took one star off due to lots of noise in low light.  If you are outside or in a brightly lit room this camera is great.

I ordered this specifically to help me see to solder up a 28 pin round connector and now I use it frequently for working on tiny stuff.  3 levels of magnification, depending on how many lenses you drop into place, the head band is easily adjustable.  My only gripe might be the side knobs don't really tighten enough.

She had beginners luck in my opinion, but she swears that she won because of what she learned from poker flash cards. To be honest though, she does have the Hold'em 101 deck and the Hand Odds deck. I have browsed through them, they do have great simple question/answer format and everything seemed very easy to comprehend. If she gets the other deck, Pot Odds, I'll probably see if it will help my game.

Though it is meant to be a charm on a bracelet, I actually just wanted a very dainty, simple daisy to wear on a necklace.  I am pleased with the quality and detail.  It is adorable.  Daisies always make me happy, and this little one does that for me. 😀  If you are buying for a bracelet, I feel you would be very happy with it.

It is very comfortable to use which allows me to be more efficient when it comes to my work.  It will also come at an affordable price which is very important for some professional welders out there.  It is also made of high quality leather that you will definitely find easy to wear and use for a very long time. Overall, I will give this product 9 out of 10.

This mod works flawless, and never skips a beat. Does wonders for Call of Duty Ghosts. Very simple to use, and there are tons of options. My game has definitely improved, that extra fire rate and some of the other functions such as drop shot and jump shot really do give you the edge. And I like how you can adjust the settings for each mode so you can choose to jump once, continue jumping, or whatever you choose. Mods can stack too which is nice. Very solid product.

5643	__label1__	5	Y	Pet Products	B00OJ3A4GY	Petiner Advanced No Bark Dog Training Electric Shock Control Collar	Amazing no bark training collar!  A+++	My Doberman Pinscher Hurley is a great guard dog, but ever since he was a puppy he would bark at anything that moved! I was a little nervous to put a shock collar on him, but the Petiner Advanced No Bark Dog Training Electric Shock Control Collar is nothing like that. After researching the product, I learned that the electric shock is more like a slight tickle which must feel like the light static-like surprise of touching a metal doorknob. After receiving the control collar and putting it on Hurley, I couldn't believe how well he responded to it! He enjoys wearing it more than his usual collar! And it worked like a charm, he stopped barking and it seemed like the impulse to bark just subsided.<br /><br />There's many products that market themselves in the training of stopping barking, but none have worked as well or have been as highly recommended as this one. It's a best buy for all pet owners!

It provides a great transition from fully ""don't think, just take the picture"" mode to full manual.  While I'm not an expert photographer by any means, I find that this gives me the tools to learn and go from ""consumer"" to ""pro-sumer"".<br /><br />I thought I'd add a my review because I had 2 problems within 3 months of purchase - first, the grip rubber issue (google it), and second the live preview button quit working.  Both are worth mentioning because Canon quickly and efficiently repaired both for free, including shipping!  I know it's bad that we have to call out excellent customer service these days, but it's good to know you're taken care of when you buy Canon products."

"I just ordered my third one in 5 years in my moderate NC climate.  This will give you a good idea of what to expect in terms of durability and value.  Fit is very good on my 48"" deck Husqvarna lawn tractor with some room to spare.  Do find puddles on the seat fairly regularly but don't know exactly why as the rest of the tractor shows zero signs of accumulated condensation, leakage, or rust under any conditions.  Cover RARELY ever comes loose.  In other words, this thing really does its job...except for the minor inconvenience of the puddle on the seat.  I suspect somehow the two rear vents must let in some moisture either in the form of rain or condensation that has only ever accumulated on the seat.  Not a huge deal since the tractor, including the deck, has been well protected for all the years I've been using this exact model of nylon cover.  I only give 4 stars because I think it should be made to last longer than two years with much of that time, in previous years at least, spent in open shade and not in direct sun.  Please note that this past year I did leave the covered tractor in the sun for the whole year and the cover disintegrated after about 1 year.  Thus, this was a ""rush"" order since my tractor is presently unprotected and the shredded old cover is in the trash.  Cover gave way without warning."

It is exactly the same height as my IKEA couch and is sturdy especially because of the lower shelf. It has no drawers and the shelf cannot be moved so it may not meet everyone's expectations. The product does not look like cheap laminated wood so for the price I think it is a good deal.

Contacted manufacture and they sent a new pre-amp and pickup, which was easy to install. This made it sound overdriven again. I got the same distortion via headphones and via amp. Other than the inconsistent electronics and unusable sound it is a nice package for the money.

These are considerably heavier than the cheapest ones. They're accurate in the wind and have a strong rebound, which is good for wall practice.<br /><br />The reason it didn't get five star is because the first ball cracked open after only about 3 hours of play. I'm not sure if playing in the rain had anything to do with it but it's the only tennis ball I've ever broke so far. The second ball is holding up well however, it's still very firm even after the letters have worn out.

For a few bucks, even if it breaks, it's not the end of the world...<br /><br />My recommendation is to pay a little more and get a better quality Apple iPhone charger."

12262	__label2__	5	Y	Grocery	B000E4C1OK	12 Pack Cincinnati Chili Mix packets	Hard Times Chili in your own home	I grew up with classic chili - spicy, not too wet. A substance of its own. A stand-alone easy dinner treat.<br /><br />One winter evening my wife and I went out for dinner and decided to pay a visit to a Hard Times Chili parlor. Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu to find three different types of chili. I'm thinking &#34;really, how different can chili recipes be?&#34; I decided to ask our waitress about the differences and she told me about Cincinnati style. The difference being the cinnamon added to the batch.<br /><br />I was so pleased that I tried this style - I LOVE cinnamon. It is one of my favorite spices. So, I dug in with some fresh cornbread and a cold beer and was so pleasantly surprised - I now had a new favorite chili recipe. The problem arose when we moved to a new location and there were no Hard Times cafes in our neighborhood. So I began the hunt for a Cincinnati style chili mix that was as good as Hard Times. After scouring Amazon for other reviews I decided to take a chance on this particular brand. It is SPOT ON to my experience at Hard Times and is a great price. We have made only a small change to the preparation instructions that are supplied with the packets - we cut the amount of water that they recommend adding to the mix by almost half and now have the same taste and consistency that we loved at Hard Times.

They are semi soft and quite crumbly. In fact most of the ones in my bag were broken. The dogs seemed to enjoy them and they suffered no ill effects. The bag is resealable which is convenient and helpful when transporting. It was hard to tell how many were in the bag since most were crumbled. They are free of corn, wheat, artificial flavors or preservatives.<br /><br />There were no guidelines for feeding other than to break into pieces for a small dog. I wasn't crazy to see that they contained both sugar (sucrose) and salt. Plus this company does not provide easily accessible information about where the ingredients are sourced. You will not find it on the website or the package. You must call Customer Service. They keep a list of the origins of the proteins but not all the ingredients. They will tell you that they do use supplements, mainly folic acid, from China.So while the dogs like them,  I will stick to treats made in sourced from the US like [[ASIN:B001FKC8W2 Stewart Beef Liver Freeze Dried (2oz)] or ones I make myself.

14155	__label2__	4	N	Outdoors	B000RLM3P2	Princeton Tec Quad 4 LED Tactical Headlamp	Great price	Unbeatable price for this quality of headlamp.  It comes with different color filters but there isn't really a way to keep them with the headlamp so I'm not sure what the point of that is.  It is nice that each click increases brightness, instead of the other way around, though in my case this wasn't essential.  Even the lowest brightness level will get the job done, though slide up the filter and you will have a very inconspicuous light.  The highest brightness is fairly impressive, not exactly a spotlight (in a dark field) but in dark room it's like the ceiling light is on, so in the woods it would probably be quite impressive.  Took it on a night hike where it got used continuously for about 4 hours and it performed well.  It wasn't super easy to get it clicked on a level that gave me both the forward vision and the amount of light on the ground I wanted, but I guess that might be asking a lot.

11030	__label2__	5	Y	PC	B008S8WA18	MSI LGA1155/Intel B75/DDR3/SATA3 USB 3.0/A&GbE/MicroATX Motherboard B75MA-P45	A budget board that packs a punch!	I purchased this board as a backup for my MSI Z77MA-G45 that I had to RMA, but also to serve as the motherboard in my test rig. This board has many things going for it, several of which I will list:<br /><br />1) It is well made, and despite being MSI's budget motherboard, it compares nicely to boards in the $100+ category.<br />2) It has four memory slots for a maximum of 32GB of RAM, not bad for a low-end board at all!<br />3) It has USB 3.0 ports, something missing from many of its competitors, and even has headers for two more!<br />4) It has a SATA3 port for getting the most of an OS SSD.<br />5) It has one each of PCIEx16, PCIEx1 and PCI, meaning you won't have to upgrade an old PCI card if you don't want to.<br />6) It is compatible with OSX with little to no modification.<br /><br />I was first drawn to MSI's motherboards after reading an article about hackintosh-compatible mATX motherboards. MSI boards, it seems, are just as easy to use as Gigabyte, and in my opinion are MUCH better looking. MSI has done a great job with the color scheme, which is understated without being too muted. With several power saving options, this is a great HTPC/general home use motherboard but don't let that put you off! It supports RAM up to 2400mhz and will play nicely with even the Core i7 processors!<br /><br />Now, I really want to take a second and mention MSI's UEFI BIOS. This thing is amazing, and if you haven'te experienced UEFI BIOS's yet, you're in for a treat. The thing looks great, has intuitive controls, and heck, you can even use your mouse! The BIOS has three settings: power saving, normal and overclocked. It has automatic overclocking (apparently going off of your components automagically) or you can overclock manually. I'm not an overclocker so I can't really comment, but I saw controls for changing clock speeds and voltages for both the CPU and the RAM, as well as various other settings which I'm sure others will find much more useful than I did!<br /><br />I tried to think of some drawbacks to this motherboard, but with USB 3.0 support and four slots of DDR3, the only minor complaint I have is that there is only one SATA3 port. Still, you can have your OS drive on the one avaialble, and the only reason I would want a second is for my test rig. Barr any possible issues like I had with my Z77MA (power cycle loop) I highly recommend this as a VERY attractive 1155 mATX board. I don't think you'll regret choosing this budget board!

Why does the photograph of the cookie on the front of the package have more macadamia nuts than four cookies in the bag?  I rate this as a 5 star cookie that loses one star for false advertising.

16300	__label2__	3	Y	Lawn and Garden	B00CRYOPMQ	BEAPCO 6-Pack Drop-Ins Fruit Fly Traps	Better than nothing, but only seem to catch some of our fruit flies	These traps sort of work. When we first got them we probably had 5 fruit flies in our kitchen. We set up two traps and within the first 4 hours we caught 2 flies. But then the last 3 flies just kept flying around, often within 6 inches of the traps, without ever getting caught. After a few weeks we threw out the first 2 traps and set up 2 more. These have 10 or 12 flies but just like before they never seem to eliminate the fruit flies entirely (and it's not as though we have a whole swarm of them to start with, either). So - better than nothing, but not 100% effective.

As a welder, a definitely recommend this product because it gives me a comfortable feeling left by the fine leather material that it is made of as well as the unique design that it possesses.  It is also very cost efficient for welders because of extremely affordable price.  It is lightweight and compact which allows me to take it wherever I may choose to go.  I never regretted availing of this product and neither will you.  Just this is the best investment that I have ever made for sure.

11154	__label2__	4	N	Baby	B00H3X811C	BRICA Stroller Organizer Plus	A little extra was all I needed…	The one thing I kind of hate about my son’s stroller is that the storage underneath is so limited I find that the diaper bag takes up the entire space and I have no room for anything else.  Not that this little organizer offers much extra space, but it offers enough space to alleviate the need to bring the diaper bag.  I can just throw in the wipes and diapers needed and leave the diaper bag in the car.  If you need some extra space, this is what you’re going to want.  It you want a lot of extra space, this isn’t going to do the trick.  It fits on the stroller handles easily enough, and it stays put.  For what I wanted it for, this certainly does the trick.
2287	__label1__	3	N	Books	1432799320	Life Lessons from Nature: Motivational Speaker, Military Strategist, Political Advisor, Scientist & Engineer, Foster Parent	Good... but it could be better !!!	I never think that we can gain much knowledge from Nature until I read this book. There are such a large number of incredible lessons of how we ought to carry on with our life the way we are intended to live. It is a short book yet notwithstanding it being so concise, it has taught us the genuine significance of life. I truly like the thought that the writer introduces in his book of how human race is worried about their life and how each of us is in a rodent race, what he calls, throughout today's life. In the wake of perusing this book, I had the capacity carry on with my life at the fullest and understood the easily overlooked details that we have a tendency to overlook and pass up a major opportunity in our occupied routine are the genuine satisfaction of life.  My just concern in regards to this book is that it required about more human related illustrations and less creature related ones. Yet other than that, this book shows us the things you would not typically get the chance to learn. So 3 stars from me.

The TV's internal antenna got weak signals so I couldn't get any channels.  I went to other stores to see what I could find for antennas.  Everything was $30 to $40 and huge.  I figured, $10 through Amazon Prime.  Why not?  Glad I got it, it's cheap and it works.  I get at least 29 channels, some with weak or staticy analog signals, but, it's better than zero before.<br /><br />I haven't even mounted it yet, just plugged it in and stuck it on a plastic jar, near my TV and it works.

At first they seemed very small for the size I ordered, but I wear them barefoot and they work.  However, I can't wear them with socks as they feel to small.  I think the next pair I order I would order the next size.  It would be helpful to have this information in the description when selecting, before purchase.
11275	__label2__	5	N	Furniture	B002VA32F2	Cozy Sack 2-Feet Kids Foam Bean Bag Chair, Small, Navy	Worth the extra money	I was looking at bean bags and almost bought a cheaper one but I am glad I spent a little more time looking at the less positive reviews on the bag I almost bought. They complained of cheapness and odor (like chemical odors). I certainly didn't want something from China off-gassing in my house. Once of the reviews recommended a Cozy Sack instead, so I looked those up and found this item.<br /><br />I ordered a 4' navy bag and it arrived today. I thought the packaging was a bit small and that it might not be big enough, but after taking it out and letting the foam absorb some air, it might even be too big for my originally desired use. It was a bit of a struggle to get it out of the tight packaging without using a knife or blade, but I managed.<br /><br />And fortunately it doesn't stink of chemicals (unless you put your nose right up to it and take a big whiff)! If it did my wife would have had me remove it right away (she is very sensitive to that).<br /><br />My 6 year old son immediately started jumping on it from a couch and had a blast. He then settled down on it and played some games on an iPad, so there's no doubt he likes it.<br /><br />I'm happy I spent a little more for what is most likely a significantly better quality bag that has a removable & washable cover. I'm also happy that I am supporting jobs in the USA, which I don't mind at all doing when they offer a higher quality product that is worth the additional cost over cheaper & lower quality Chinese made products.<br /><br />Unfortunately the 4' was too big for us but the customer service was excellent and helped us convert it into 2x 2' bag chairs by exchanging the cover & bags. I transferred the foam 'stuffing' from the 4' to the 2x 2' bags.<br /><br />By the way, currently the photo for the 2' navy bag with the child sitting on it shows a lighter blue color. The actual color is a darker navy blue as you might expect.<br /><br />Here's some size info:<br /><br />The 2' size has a diameter of 34&#34; and is 20&#34; high<br />The 3' size has a diameter of 44&#34; and is 24&#34; high.<br />The 4' size has a diameter of 48&#34; and is 27&#34; high.<br />The 5' size has a diameter of 48&#34; and is 40&#34; high.<br /><br />So 5 stars from me... should anything change then I'll definitely update this review.

Nutty flavor	Quinoa has been used as a food in South America for more than 3,000 years and has grown in popularity and availability in the U.S. in the past few years.  It is an excellent plant source of protein, fiber, minerals, and B vitamins. It is also gluten-free.<br /><br />This quinoa from is of excellent quality, with no debris or defective grains, and it is clean even before rinsing.  It is organically grown on farms in the high Andes.<br /><br />Quinoa has a slightly nutty taste and it works well as a substitute for rice or couscous.  It cooks up faster than rice, which is convenient.  When cold, it makes a nice addition to a green salad.  It is especially good with a little olive, avocado, or nut oil drizzled on it.  It can even be sprouted before cooking.<br /><br />Soul Organics provided quinoa for evaluation and review.

I must admit they are the first closed ear headphones. I've tried beyerdynamic, beats and sennheiser and they are equally good, but like the beyer i just find ridiculously expensive and yet sounds thesame as the m50. You can hear everything, midrange and bass is just fantastic. I spent quite a fortune on these but having tried those that were half a grand I feel like I snatched this one right out of the store.

10531	__label2__	4	N	Watches	B0066T2IAY	Fossil Men's JR1357 Nate Chronograph Black Leather Watch	Beautiful large watch with easy to read clean face	"As a watch lover, this watch is a beautiful piece to wear and enjoy.  This is a large watch, the face is 50mm across, and about 53mm when you include the protruding hands and timer buttons.  I've had my watch a few months now and it's accurate and keeps good time.  The day counter does need to be adjusted forward when there's less than 31 days in a month.  The watch bezel rotates counter clockwise and clicks to lock in place.  Oddly enough it has 7 clicks for each 5 minutes, which really isn't an issue because it does line up on each 5 minute indicator.<br /><br />The band is very thick and robust leather.  The band is about 3mm thick and thus about as thick as the buttons that stick out on the right side.  One great feature of the band is that it includes the really simple to use Fossil release slider on each half.  On the under-side where it connects to the watch case there is a small spring loaded tab you simply side one way to release the bands.  This makes them easy to trade out for many of the other available options.  For example Fossil sells a silicone rubber band that I also enjoy and it's a simple process to make the change.  This opens up the option of having different colors for different looks and or outfits or occasions.<br /><br />The watch has a timer which will keep track by the second up to 30 minutes.  There's a second hand timer (bottom center dial) in addition to the sweep second hand.  There's a 30 minute small counter (upper left small dial).  The upper right small dial is a 24 hour time that shows you which hour of 24 the watch is showing.  I like the sweep second hand and appreciate that since many watches no longer have that.  The top button is the ""start/stop"" timer function.  The lower button is the ""reset"" button once you've stopped the timer.<br /><br />One of the additional features this watch includes is that any of the Fossil stores will replace the battery for $10 and guarantee it for a year.  That's a pretty nice benefit when manywatch shops can charge $30 or more for a new battery.<br /><br />This is a large watch, you need to keep it up on your wrist a little to keep the button protrusions from bumping into your wrist as you bend your wrist.  If you had a job where there was a risk of a possible snag or catch risk I would suggest a smaller watch.  Of course the trend now is for these larger watches.  This one is very easy to read with a clean simple font for the face.  The internal characters are very clean cut from what appears to be raised plastic and have a nice 3D look.<br /><br />4 stars for a beautifully crafted watch that I enjoy wearing."

The software is more for geeks but if you have ever went into a router and changed some setting then you should have not problem with the tonidoplug. It can do worlds more then I thought it could even without me having to do much.  It took no time to find out how to connect it over my network to my mac using the lan to add files or how to stream movies from it to the VLC player on my mac.

I took a chance and I'm glad I did, it tilts inward a little (and it is difficult to hide rail under because futon is not stiff like a mattress), but am very happy with how it is working. Would have gave 5 stars if only they could have put that huge blue paragraph of warning text someplace else- it is unsightly. You either have to look at is while in bed or turn it out so you see it while outside the bed.

5349	__label1__	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B00SEACESE	ANDROID TV BOX -FULLY LOADED KODI / XBMC -FULLY UNLOCKED -WATCH ANYTHING	truly impressed with it !	I recently purchased this box on Amazon and I have been truly impressed. I have owned several other android tv boxes as well as a raspberry pi 2 so I am not a novice with them. My hats off to the folks at Vilso for  not only putting out a quality product but also going the distance to be one of the first to offer sound support as well as loaded with all the things needed to make it the best box on the market bar none I have ever used. The box boots up lightening fast and everything flows smoothly as it should. Having the extra GB of memory makes a huge difference. xbmc works better on this box than any of the others I have used. The repos installed have everything one could wish for. I've used this for nearly a month now of hard use and have yet to have the first issue with it. The only thing I could wish for is a better design in the factory remotes but now its coming together with an additional air mouse remote control that makes it much better I'm a happy camper.

12731	__label2__	5	Y	Musical Instruments	B000GAQP5S	Fender Deluxe Players Strat, Rosewood Fretboard - Honey Blonde	Worth It	This is a REALLY GREAT buy.  To try to help everybody really enjoy this product, just a few notes.  First off on the condition:<br /><br />The condition is really perfect because of the packaging Fender uses.  So damage should never be a problem.  If you see a torn carton though, then worry.<br /><br />Then on to as advertised:  I thought it would come with a whammy bar, but it is only built for the whammy bar, so you need the bar.  Otherwise the Guitar and the bag are exactly as advertised.  The cloth bag is one of the better bags I've seen over the years.<br /><br />BIG and IMPORTANT notes:  The neck bar comes loose with minimum pressure.  After bringing the guitar to tune you will need to tighten the neck bar with a 3/16&#34; allen wrench about 3 turns or so till the neck comes straight by looking down the neck/frets from behind/beside the tuners.  I had to also adjust the string length on the E,A and G strings.  If you don't want to deal with those issues, I think Guitar Center/Guitar shops do setups for 15 - 25 bucks.  I would definitely do that for the guitar within the 30 day warranty to make sure the guitar is within specs anyway.  The point of this whole thing though, is the guitar comes not set up.  To really enjoy it either set it up or have it setup.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a hot little guitar that has an absolutely stunning sound.  I'm enjoying it greatly!

When not in use it can be folded flat to keep it anywhere in compact space. The material quality is fantastic and its also waterproof, so no worries for spills and drops there. The other thing i like is, it comes with life time warranty which is a huge plus there for such a cheap price.

It is a nice little fire/BBQ pit for a backyard patio but it is high maintenance. First off the single poorly placed drain hole is useless if you burn anything which produces aches. I drilled three additional holes to help with drainage. Even with a cover this pit will start rusting within a few weeks so purchase a few cans of some good rust resistance paint and customize your pit to your liking. Other than the few expected issues I have enjoyed this pit.

14796	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B000X2RUX0	Everlasting Large Bento Ball	We love this.	My dog loves this treat and toy. I put kibble in one side and the everlasting treat in the other. Good for her teeth, keeps her busy, but I have to keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't pop the toy out and eat it all quickly. Is it perfect? No. My dog tore part of it which is disappointing, but my dog really loves this toy and this toy is for her. She gets very excited when I have a new everlasting treat to put in it. It gives her something to focus her energy on and it's easy and quick to refill. Once a month I get a couple everlasting treats on autodelivery which makes the treat a lot cheaper (about $2.50 a piece). For me, I'm happy it's a dental treat. I want my dog to have nice teeth for a long time and I am happy to say that this toy/treat is making everyone happy around here.<br /><br />Bonus: it is NOT noisy. It's a silicon-ish kind of material so even when it's bouncing around on our ceramic floors it doesn't make much of a sound. A lot of dog toys are cheap and noisy. And annoying. This one isn't. So if you are seeking out toys that are quiet this is a good one.

So I just had to get them this cool, lighting up dino lego for them. It got delivered a day before the estimated time of arrival so an A+ for they're service. As for the quality, I would actually give it an A++!<br /><br />On delivery, I unboxed the structure and checked for any missing block or proper instruction. As I have had a pretty bad experience with a few other lego set I bought earlier. I checked to make sure and this had no issue at all, and the quality of the plastic was superb!<br /><br />Getting through with the unboxing and the checkup, me and the boys first tried to make the model on our own, with no success, I downloaded their video guide. I was no hard to find as they had it on their website. The video explain a few thing we were doing wrong and voila. the t-rex was up and lit at its best! I was honestly very impressed with this laser pegs. It was a great fun to put it together with the boys. Now both of them play with it together, and make the rest of the 23 dinosaur models on their own!

It smells so good too, It doesn't mention about cucumber but it smells like it. Very refreshing on the face, I left it for 20 minutes as advised and I could already feel the cooling effect of it on my face...and that was even just the first time I tried it! When I took it off my face felt and looked super clean and refreshed. I may be exaggerating in this review but it's in all honesty. You have to try this product to know...I mean, if you frequent the facial spa, you might be changing your mind as soon as you see this for yourself.

14609	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B00JKER2YE	Petiner Basic No bark control collar	It works	Bought this for our chihuahua and it worked immediately after the first couple barks.  We only need to use it every once in a while now.  Our Yorkie was only started barking when we brought home our chihuahua so we used it on him and he also stopped barking immediately.  Since it also has a beep we can also just press the beep button (when they are not wearing it) and they immediately associate the beep with the feeling of the collar so they stop barking.  I only bought this because of the previous reviews.  The cheap price had me hesitant but I'm glad I bought it.  It works and I'm glad we didn't have to spend a lot of money since it took a short time to get them to stop barking.

15152	__label2__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B00006I5R7	Sennheiser E835 Dynamic Cardioid Vocal Microphone	Excellent quality in a competitive price range	"Like several other reviewers I'd been using SM58's until trying these out and was blown away. We use these for vocals in both a rehearsal studio environment and live performance. They run thru dbx 286A preamp/compressor/gates in normal use but when we got the first one I a/b tested it against the Shure straight into the console as well. Here's my rundown:  * sonically they have wider response, just a little bit more at the bottom and noticeably more extension at the top. To my ears it's slightly warm but with a good sense of air, not rolled-off.  * very good off-axis rejection, this mic has practically eliminated feedback issues for us without resorting to hard gating like I had to with the 58's. On the other hand, our singers have to remember to sing more directly into the mic. Minimal proximity effect as well. Plosives are well controlled, about the same as the Shure.  * sturdy construction, minimal handling noise, good weight balance, feels slightly heavier than the 58.  * first reaction when the band saw them was ""ooo sexy"". I dunno about sexy but it IS a nice looking mic.  Overall these are a nice improvement. I have now replaced my 58's with e835's and could hardly be happier with the results. Microphone qualities are highly subjective so listen to both back to back if at all possible, and decide for yourself! The e835 may not be right for you but in my case have exceeded expectations."

11552	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B007W94VH0	Estroven Maximum Strength One Per Day, 60 Caplets	a staple in my pantry after my hysterectomy	It's true you reach a certain time in your life your pantry is always stocked with certain treats and luxuries. Mine are really good chocolate, really nice wines, Mallomars and Estroven. Sometimes I need two sometimes I don't take any at all. Life without them is hot and wet...not it a good way either. (You know itchy, bitchy and twitchy?) Estroven helps with my mood swings and I don't sweat at night as bad but i still do. I still have those waves of electric fire but not as intense or often with estroven. Also I had a complete hysterectomy about 7 years ago. I was taken from the operating room with one of those hormone patches. At that time they were $50 each month.  But after some research i decided synthetic hormones weren't for me and Biodentical or whatever they are called were too pricey. I tried black cohosh, st john's wort and various holistic herbal concoctions. It took about a week and a half before these took full effect and i've used them ever since. These are working so i'll keep buying them as they are a value price wise for me too. I was paying $17 for 28 at my local shopping mart. Free shipping to my door instead of an hour round trip to town, so estroven on amazon is a good deal for me... and those around me. Although my memoryfoam mattress has a right to be peeved.

It would have fit my baby girl just before she was 3 months old, and that was IT. But since I didn't need it till she was 3 months old (It was too big for her as a newborn) she never got to wear it. At three months it was too small for her head, and so I had to get rid of it unused. The material inside is satiny, too, which seems nice in theory, but it plays out terribly for warmth. All in all I consider this a completely useless hat.<br />If your looking for cute and warm, check out Smartwool's baby hats (socks, too!), and I also liked Baby Soy's baby hats.

While the graphics may not be on par with the Xbox One and PS4, the games in my opinion are a good chunk of what makes a console great and Wii U has some GREAT first party games! Now, as for third party games there are some games that are very good, and while the graphics may not be on par, the gameplay for me is a lot more enjoyable. Now, I am a PC gamer, I love having great graphics, which is why I was hesitant in buying the Wii U. But I get almost all my 3rd party support on PC, so why buy a console that has CERTAINLY not as good first party games. And the gamepad is wonderful, it is another reason I bought the Wii U, I am typing right now on the gamepad. It just makes everything more enjoyable. Alright well, I could go on and on but this, sadly, was my short reveiw. Thanks for listening

11386	__label2__	4	N	Furniture	B005ETZIMM	basyx by HON VL103 Mid-Back Leather Executive Task Chair for Office or Computer Desk, Black	Sleek look, upright chair for back support, but this is not an ergonomic chair..	In my old job, we would have to undergo ergonomic training and testing and we were given the best ergonomic seats of the time.  And since then, I have been trying out different chairs that are stylish, not too expensive but most of all, provides comfort and good back support.  If I can find an ergonomic office chair for a low price, I would be happy but most of the time, anything within the $50-$200 range are typically straightforward chairs.<br /><br />This leads me to the latest office chair that I am using in the office...the basyx VL103 by Hon.<br /><br />I.  INSTALLATION<br /><br />Installation was easy.  Actually, I came home and my wife already had put it together and she said it took her less than half an hour.  I did notice that when it came in, the chair came with the original toolset but also came with a newer revised tool-set that was affixed to the top of the box. So, there must have been a revision to this chair.<br /><br />II.  STYLE<br /><br />I love the look of the basyx VL103.  Leather seat (not thick leather), chrome stands and also under the arm rest area and because of the way it looks and it's not all plastic, is probably why it's close to $150 (on Amazon).  It's very sleek and of the several office chairs that I have owned, this is the best looking one that I have had so far.<br /><br />III.  COMFORT & EASE OF USE<br /><br />Upon putting it together, you have one lever that adjusts the up and down movement and there is a tilt tension, so you can pull the lever out and tilt it to become upright and lock or for those who want to adjust the tilt of the chair.  But this is not an ergonomic seat, so you can't adjust the back, nor can you adjust the seat to move it up or curved.  But there is good enough padding on the seat area and really good support for the mid-back.<br /><br />This is important to know because typically, for an office chair around $100 or so, the back seat is not upright and they are not as durable.  This one makes you sit in agood posture and that's what I enjoy about it so far.  Granted, I still want an ergonomic chair that I can always adjust (especially long hours of working) but many of them are expensive.  For this seat at under $150, it's great in mid-back support and having you sit in a straight position.<br /><br />And the caster wheels work good.  I use a mat around my desk area and am able to move freely.<br /><br />IV.  JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />One of the difficult things about purchasing an office chair online is that you want to sit on one before buying.  It's important as all chairs are subjective to the one using it.  But I can say that this is not a cheap chair with mesh backing, nor is it a chair with a flimsy back support.  For it's price and it's style, it's definitely worth it at the under $150 price point.<br /><br />With that being said... For those who suffer from back problems, you probably want to look for an ergonomic seat but you're going to have to pay a little more for it (see [[ASIN:B004LQ1URQ Office Star WorkSmart Professional Dual Function Ergonomic High Back Eco Leather Chair, Black]] or if you want the best and are willing to pay over $500 (see [[ASIN:B003Y5BF7A ErgoHuman Executive Chair with Headrest in Black]]).  Also, note that there are ergonomic chairs sold on Amazon that are cheaper than this chair, but they tend to break easy (the lever or pivots, so beware of cheap ergonomic office chairs).<br /><br />But if you need one that will force you to sit in a good posture but also feels comfortable especially around the mid-back, and most importantly, won't hurt your pocketbook, the basyx VL103 by Hon is worth considering!

11312	__label2__	3	Y	Lawn and Garden	B000LF882G	Solo 0610410-P Sprayer Brass Adjustable Nozzle Kit	Second thoughts three months later...	"Original review with 5 stars:  I ordered the Solo 4900647-P 29-Inch Universal Stainless Steel Sprayer Wand And Shut-off Valve and when reading the reviews discovered that the nozzle that comes with the wand is non-adjustable.  I added this to the order and it fit perfectly and is a quality piece of equipment.  Unscrew the one that came with the wand and screw this on.  From jet to fan, I've got it all now.    3 months later with 3 stars:  The adjustment of this brass nozzle became more and more finicky and frustrating.  I don't know what changed.  Everything is clean, the filter screen, the nozzle, the works.  In frustration I ordered the ""Solo 4900654-P Sprayer Elbow Nozzle Assembly Plus Standard Nozzle Assortment"".  Much better.  We shall see how I feel about it after a time.  I figured metal is better than plastic, in this case that doesn't seem to be true."

My daughter always has a drink and the cup doesn't fit correctly I this.<br /><br />The whole mix & match thing is not my cup of tea. This should include a sunshade. My stroller cost just as much as this seat. It came with a large basket and a sunshade.<br /><br />While the seat itself is nice, it's not affordable for the average household. There's too many things I don't love about this stroller to fork out that kind of money.

As a side note, I started taking this for blood pressure, but noticed a slight... ""viagra"" effect, each time I take the recommended dosage on an empty stomach. I also started taking tribulus, [[ASIN:B006QRHMWU 25 Grams (0.88 Oz) Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder (Strongest Tribulus on the market)]] which enhanced these effects ten-fold. Not the reason I initially sought out this supplement, but you won't hear me complaining. The powder form of L-Arginine (and anything for that matter) is something I prefer over pills since the cost gets cut in half, literally and I notice taking the powder has a more immediate effect rather than waiting for the capsules to disintegrate. Either way, L-Arginine is a terrific solution for lowering the blood pressure and upping performance in the bedroom, and a little bit of tribulus doesn't hurt either ; )"

13327	__label2__	3	N	Pet Products	B002J3SJXG	Nrg Maxim Grainless Dog Food Diet Chicken and Veggie, 10-Pound	Hardly what I would call species appropriate, but better than kibble	"The maker of this diet claims the following about NRG Maxim Grainless Dog Food Diet on the website:<br />""It is goodness you can actually see, not just when you read the label, but from the moment you open the box and recognize shredded fruits and vegetables like in your own trail mix.Enzyme active fresh fruits and vegetables provide enriched immune system support. Vegetable based carbohydrates combine with dietary fats to supply energy in a balance that does not stress the pancreas. Not only is meat the first ingredient, it is more than 1/2 the formulaFor everyday convenience NRG is the refreshing way to provide enzyme rich whole food nourishment...NO SHORT CUTS...Quality without compromise...<br />The Best Raw Food Value...1 KG of dry measure Maxim is caloricly equal to 10 lbs of frozen food.""<br /><br />My notes:<br />Shredded fruits and veggies are simply filler and are not digested by dogs. On the other hand, the powdered, raw veggies and fruit that the manufacturer knocks will offer some enzymes, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, etc. Sadly the shredded produce in this product is simply a great way to waste your money ($15/lb for something that costs the manufacturer $1/lb). I am not against people making money, but I am against deceptive marketing. This product is better than a lot of pet foods, just don't fool yourself into thinking it's better than a home-prepared or commercial, frozen raw diet.<br /><br />As for meat being ""more than 1/2 the formula..."" I should hope so. Exactly when did it become acceptable to make meat and animal products less than 95% of the diet of a carnivore?<br /><br />As for this product being the best raw food value, I have to laugh. Even if the wet (""frozen"") weight equaled 4.5 times the dry weight of the finished product you're still only getting about 50% meat.<br /><br />UPDATE: Years after posting this review I have finally found a freeze-dried raw diet that is worth it's price. I've been feeding ""The Real Meat"" freeze dried,grass-fed, New Zealand beef formula [[ASIN:B00B2F5ZR0 Real Meat Freeze Dried Dog Food - Beef 1 lb]]and think it is far more sensible than the NRG. The Real Meat has as much as 35% more beef, and the cost is about 35% more (when you buy the 4lb bag). Because it's mostly beef and has no undigestible ingredients, it's more energy dense, and more efficient to store. Pound for pound, when comparing the beef portion of the diet, the cost for ""The Real Meat"" freeze dried beef is the same as NRG.  In my opinion, The Real Meat is better quality as it's pasture-raised beef. New zealand is known for it's beautiful, green pastures and delicious, healthy beef. In addition to the beef being a better quality, the food is boosted with vitamins, kelp, and supplements that might help a lot of pets.<br /><br />I am not bashing NRG, if you notice I have always given it 3 stars. Those of you who accuse me of having a conflict of interest, ought to back off a bit. I just want pet food companies to make better food and make and supply it in the most efficient manner (no filler ingredients). My only wish is for animals to be healthier and the best way to go about this is to help their owners afford really nutritious food.<br /><br />I just noticed this statement on the NRG beef description and wanted to add a comment for safety reasons:<br /><br />""Why feed messy inconvenient raw diets that require diligent food safety practices when you can simply add water to create the ultimate balanced fresh, raw no grain dog food ration for your canine. ""<br /><br />If NRG is raw and not pasteurized, then the second it is rehydrated it needs to be treated just as a fresh/frozen raw food would be. In other words, if you feel it's imperative to wash your dog's bowl after he eats raw meat, you should also do so after feeding NRG. There may be an innactivation of the bacteria while it is dry, but once those bacteria are in a moist environment, many will be revived. My advice is to use Puregreen24 [[ASIN:B002P0EVV2 PureGreen24 antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal green disinfectant 32oz Spray (Pure Green 24)]] to wipe down bowls after each meal if you don't have time to put them through the dishwasher."

Chalk has changed forever-clean chalk pens are fun and fancy	Sure you can get a chalkboard, create an entire chalkboard wall with chalkboard spray paint from Home Depot, spray the inside of your pantry to make a chalkboard...but the real fun may come in using these in gourmet and creative ways.<br /><br />I like to get slabs of slate or a similar stone with some grit at a garden or Hardware store, wash, and layout gourmet foods and appetizers when I entertain and use the chalk markers on them to identify each item.  These actually make a table look beautiful, especially if you can find ones that are not square cut (although those work great too).  This also makes a great hostess gift to skip the usual bottle of wine you bring as a gift, lay some cheeses out on a slate, and give them the pack of chalk markers.  People go wild over that one.<br /><br />Chalk is messy and dusty and unpleasant in so many ways--including breathing it.  Not so here.  No big nibs, no dust, no mess, no rubbing off--what you do is prime the marker by pressing the tip down until the chalk &#34;ink&#34; flows through.  Then start writing!<br /><br />When it's time to wipe off? A damp rag takes it all off--but it  does not rub off like regular chalk otherwise.<br /><br />It is far more easy to write with this.  And make it look good when you do it!<br /><br />It's nice to have lots of colors and be able to label the different names of cheeses etc. in different colors, or give each kid a color if you want to keep a wall planner calendar and label events for each person, another color for family events, another color for to do list etc.<br /><br />Great for kids to draw on because you can give them chalkboards, they can get colorful, wipe off and start again.<br /><br />Great to take a long board, spray paint it with chalkboard spray, have everyone write notes about what they love about a birthday person and have it run down the center of a table for a birthday party--nice for the photos and memories and for everyone to get to do and read.  Especially theguest of honor!<br /><br />Chalk provided by Chalk this Way

While it is very sturdy the picture shows a table with six chairs (which is what we ordered) but the table is only large enough for four chairs. The table top also came with a slight ding on the top. The chairs that go with the table are beautiful and quite sturdy though.

19775	__label2__	1	Y	Shoes	B00120ZR9G	TOMS Women's Classic Woven Slip-on,Burlap,9.5 M	At first, I was satisfied...	I purchased these shoes for myself as a birthday present Spring of last year. Originally, I was thrilled with them. They arrived in a timely manner, fit good n looked nice. I was working two jobs then, so in all honesty..they were  almost never worn. I just noticed the other day when I decided to wear them that the burlap is splitting apart. That night I saw someone with the same shoes, so I started to compare. (Her shoes are authentic Toms). After comparing, I realized the ones I bought are knock-offs. I'm not going to say that every pair this seller has isn't authentic, but beware that you just may get that. I'm giving one star, because I value honesty. It isn't right that I paid full price for a pair of knock-offs.

10826	__label2__	5	Y	Luggage	B00HHBR008	TravelWise Packing Cube System - Durable 5 Piece Weekender Plus Set [2014 Version] (Teal)	Magically makes the capacity of your suitcase increase	I'd never previously used anything other than plastic bags to contain things in my suitcase.  I saw discussions online about how packing cubes really help consolidate your items to make room for more stuff.  So I thought I'd try the Travelwise Cube System.  I just got back from a six-day trip, and I have to say that I am very favorably impressed with the quality and performance of these cubes.  I got waaay more into a carry-on size suitcase than I would have previously believed possible.  I just rolled my clothes, and put them into a cube, stacked in a row just like pencils in a box.  And surprisingly, this method did not result in the clothes coming out badly wrinkled.<br /><br />These cubes are extremely well-made.  The seams and the zippers appear to be quite strong, and the materials are high quality.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!<br /><br />(Bonus:  TSA can see exactly what's inside the cube, so your clothes don't get rummaged through during security checks.)

19313	__label2__	5	Y	Sports	B001WJ577O	"UTG Shooter's SWAT Bipod, Rubber Feet, Height 6.2""-6.7"""	Nice inexpensive bipod.	UTG Bipod, First off I'm  not a big bipod fan. I find having to adjust the legs to level the scope is just a hassle. I find it easier to sandbag a rifle. I own a Harris bipod for some of my Tactical rifles but rarely use it. I needed an inexpensive option for my 10-22 so I was looking for something cheap. I saw this for 20.00 and said what the hey and free shipping too ! I was stoked when I received this. This is really well made for 20.00. Machining was a little crude but this is expected from Chinese made products. A hole in the threaded nut for the bipod adapter was drilled a bit off center though. This was a quick fix on the drill press. The adapter fit the Ruger well and looks good. It has a black painted finish. The friction leg nuts and release buttons are nicely finished. Good enough for a .22 or a bolt action .223. The bipod is bulky when folded up and is a bit obtrusive. I would not put it on an assault rifle as it would snag on things when on the move. This a GREAT deal for your non extended magazine rifle like a Ruger 10-22 or maybe an SKS.

17645	__label2__	5	Y	Luggage	B005UNECNS	Maxwell Scott Luxury Black Leather Bag Strap - One Size	I highly recommend this very dependable strap and the excellent service of this country.	I highly recommend this item. The price on this may have gone up some, I bought one some time ago. This is a VERY GOOD strap. One of the frequent problems with such items is that the metal is often a very low quality, planned obsolescence type of metal that I believe is called &#34;pot metal&#34;, almost something like metal manufacturing leftover scrap materials, and the mechanism when a strap is made of that will tend to bend out of shape or break, or bend out of shape and then break when you bend it back.<br /><br />I bought this strap back more than a year and a half ago. I am kind of rough as far as loading a bag up a lot and was using the strap to often walk four miles a day to a bus plus sometimes hanging groceries off the bag on the way back. What I say then is not typical entirely typical use But the strap lasted and lasted and lasted in spite of my putting great strain on it. It lasted a lot longer than any strap I had ever had, perhaps about a year and a half or more, when straps usually gave out on me in, perhaps, two months. One day it broke. I had overpacked my bag and then had additional materials hanging from it.<br /><br />This may sound silly, but I actually felt saddened, because I had been able to depend upon this strap like no other.<br /><br />Then the thought occurred to me to check on whether there was a guarantee. There was, and although I had to mail the strap in to them, they promptly, courteously, without question or grumbling fixed it.<br /><br />If you are an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, you will not need this strap. But if you have to depend on a strap to carry a bit of weight and you need for it to last, I highly recommend this strap.<br /><br />And if you ARE an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, try to get the producer to supply you with this strap with the stipulation that you will be allowed to take it home.

I was surprised at how cute it actually it. It is a decent size, about 3 1/2 inches across by 4 inches tall. The pink of the bow is painted on. Skullettes eyes are are made of red plastic and light up and flash at different speeds in perfect conjuction with the sound of the alarm. There are five different sounds: 1)Thunder, 2) a wolf howl, 3) loud buzzer, 4) school bell, 5)scream. This is pretty clever as it covers some of the monster themes, (thunder for frankie, wolf howl for clawdeen). It is loud and I imagine would have quite a ""startle"" effect on someone who did not know what it was. Like I said, I don't use it as an alarm but I love this little Skullette and I am glad I bought her!!"

10866	__label2__	2	N	Furniture	B008P7T4LQ	South Shore Morgan Collection Storage Cabinet, Royal Cherry	Heavy, not real wood, chipped and scratched, looks fine...	"Stay away from this product. Go to IKEA (much better quality) or any local store. Basically, you'll get a higher quality product at a lower price. I guess if you don't have an Ikea or a similar store anywhere near by...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Color is a nice darker cherry/<br />- Marker included (more on this later)<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- Very heavy. At around 125 pounds, I was expecting it to have some solid wood pieces, mixed in with some laminate ones. However, it's all laminate, not one piece of it is made of real wood.<br />- Putting it together was cumbersome but relatively straight forward, you have to hammer in a few pieces (per the instructions) that on other similar products you typically screw in.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Every single one of the 10 or so ""wood"" pieces was scratched. Not one of them came in perfect shape. Vendor is well aware of it, as they send you a brown market to paint over the chipped/scratched sections. The good thing I can say, is that the marker hides those defects effectively. (one of the reasons this gets 2 stars instead of just 1)<br />- Instructions are poor. In one page they will tell you to attached something one way, in the next page the drawing will have them a different way. (the first page was right...)<br />- Hard to align, any slight push from the side readjusts it slightly. lets say align: | |  push a bit to accommodate to a corner and it ends up: / / (obviously not that inclined, but it doesn't keep its shape very well).<br />- Expensive. At around 200 dollars, I was expecting a slightly higher quality product. Say a grade or two above Ikea, as opposed to much lesser quality.<br /><br />If this was made of real wood, (or have at least the outer more visible pieces (say the doors) made of real wood, and scratches were limited, the product would have been a 4 star product. As it stands, given the price tag, and what similar products can be had for at IKEA, I cannot recommend this cabinet."

Also, being a guy, I wash everything together, and dark items do not seem to bleed into the lighter-colored items.<br /><br />Does it prevent ""shape loss, fiber damage and pilling?""  Time will tell, but other Woolite formulas have this earned reputation, especially with heavier fabrics such as sweaters and jeans.<br /><br />This brand of Woolite does have a flowery fragrance to it, but only mildly so after doing a load of wash with it.<br /><br />This Woolite is easy on stuff because it is not as abrasive as other laundry detergents.  When it comes to machine washing, Woolite is one of the best."

But with the revelations in Paneta's book and the resignation of Hagel from Gates' former position reveal the egomaniacal, micro-manager Obama is as leader.<br />The depth of his commitment to the men and women who serve our country is undeniable, and his desire to see victory in these wars is in contradiction to the President who came into office in 2009. His philosophy was politically-based, with no concern for the service personnel or countries we were deserting. His philosophy was to appease his political constituents and own ideas.<br />Gates presentation painted all participants in a true light, not all flattering or degrading, just personal perception. Clinton comes off well, Biden as incompetent and Obama as an amateur. With movement in the DOD recently, his insights need to be heeded.

Because of that, this fits well - honestly I could have just ordered one size larger.  The lace-up back is GREAT, it enables you to open the laces up, snap it on in front, then pull the laces & tighten it up.  The ONLY thing I have to do is put a hook & eye closure at the very top in front - so it closes flat.  Great product for the cost.

Are these worth the retail price of a hundred and twenty. They might be. They sound great. They're very comfortable. They look good. The build quality might be a little better. I can see spending one twenty for these and being happy, but at the price they're going for now, I'd be over the moon. These are a good deal, great sound and not much money. You can't beat that.

This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.<br /><br />The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

It presents so well, looks like it is worth way more than I got it for. I use it every morning, I love the aroma in the house. I haven't tried espresso from it yet, but I am sure I will get compliments when I do it over Easter. I think I understand the four screen system, the important part is that I love the flavor of the coffee it produces. I actually prefer tea so I will also use it for that as well, but for now, I am outnumbered as the rest of the household likes their coffee. Maybe I should just buy another one!

I must admit, I do not think these headphones bass matches those of headphones such as Beats, but the overall quality is significantly better. Acoustics, quality, highs and lows and clarity at loud values are AMAZING. Comfort is also great with these, although they do tend to slide down time to time (but that could just be my head). The last pair of headphones I had were Bose, and these are very comparable in quality and performance.

I appreciated this, since I ended up pumping earlier than I'd intended to, due to the infant needing supplementation in the early days.  I'd started out with a pump provided by insurance. Once I ordered this system and started pumping, my output (on the same day I'd used the hospital pump)  doubled.  Definitely worth the investment if you need to maximize milk production.

Josh Fox's research breaks it down on each level from beginning to end. It's easy to follow and involves real people and their stories.  I live in Western Pennsylvania, my family is starting to experience many of the same occurrences that Josh has documented.  Money IS the root of all evil.  One last note....just because city folks can turn their faucets on and have clean running and drinkable water, I hope that they don't think that they're immune to ever having bad water.  FACT, once these chemicals are injected into the ground, they are THERE FOREVER. (And I know what I am about to say is a strong statement, but no offense to anyone {I'm just trying to put it in perspective}) Even God himself cannot filter the chemicals from the fracking fluids.  God Bless this country, and may he open enough eyes before it's too late.  Thank you Josh for breaking this subject WIDE open!!!

It seems to have come dead level, as it should, but sometimes they don't.<br /><br />the laser shell is a very intelligent design. The top spins freely and smoothly with the down point at the center. So you can put the dawn point on your mark, then spin the body till its square or parallel etc. Then the micro adjuster picks up and works smoothy.Very fast easy laser to set up. I would struggle for sometimes 20-30 min with my old box Laser to set it perfect. This one is right away, first try.<br /><br />Cons, the 3° (5°?) self leveling range is very small. it really wants that bubble night on the middle. you really have to adjust the little tripod legs every time. Pro, the legs adjust well, smoothly and fast. Easy to get good at. the beeping when your trying to set it up is somewhat loud and angry.<br /><br />Con 2, the gap at the bottom, between the down point and the beginning of the line is bigger then I hoped. 2-3 ft. Can screw you up in some situations.<br /><br />3, tripod legs are spread to wide to fit on a 2×4 plate, cant use it as a point laserto plumb up studs.<br /><br />4. How long will it last? dont know yet. But at $120.-. Who cares? you can buy the 700$ PLS Version, and it go bad in a year. And by the way, the Chinese generic came first. the PLS ripped off of this.

Instead of replacing the one, I thought she'd enjoy having the whole set. Funny thing though, the four holes that she found drilled into her suitcase during a trip, and for which the airline compensated her, turned out to be the holes from a metal tag on the luggage. She found that out when the tag came off of one of the new ones and she saw the same four holes. Although she loves the luggage, the brand tags are not attached very securely.

10817	__label2__	5	N	Baby	B00HAZSBIG	Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower Toy	Redesign seems to have done the trick...	"My toy arrived and I admit I had some frustration getting it out of the packaging, this little bird was tied in TIGHT.  I'm glad I didn't alert my little one that it had arrived because he would have had to wait a LONG time for me to first get the thing out of the packaging and then try to get the battery cover off to get the batteries in.    Once I had achieved that herculean task though, operation couldn't have been more smooth.  There's a little button for off and on at the top of birdies' head and that's all it takes for him to start up the fun after you add the bubble solution.  You can use any type of bubble solution you like undiluted.    I found that this does actually seem to be best for the tub or barring that, outdoors because of the wetness factor.  I personally would NEVER use this indoors except in the tub.  It does tend to get wet underneath and around the unit, so if that is going to be an issue just place it on top of a towel or something like that.  Really - I think that is why this is labeled as a ""tub toy"" primarily.    It works well and delights children.  I had no issues with the operation of it.  Especially boisterous youngsters may accidentally knock this over if using this outside without aid of the suction cup.... so supervision might be in order.    EDIT 2-17-15 Still working well on original set of batteries.   I do note that if you don't empty out the bubble stuff each time or run it out that it will leak out.   We have just taken to leaving this permanently in the bathroom tub on the ledge so it's not that big a deal but worth noting if you want to conserve your bubbles or think you might be returning to ""use them later"".   I also note that when we switched bubble brands to a cheaper one we can't use it continually for more than five minutes at a time.... we have to let the bird ""rest"" because the bubbles get too thick and sudzy and it can't spit them out as well.   So if we turn it off for a few minutes then turn it on again that seemsto do the trick.  We could go back to using the more expensive bubbles.... but since our system works and our 4 year old seems ok with our explanation of the bird needing to ""rest"" it doesn't seem to pressing to pay more money."

Not the prettiest or most comfortable bag what with the unpaded shoulder strap but it's perfect for someone looking for something durable and hard wearing.

11313	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B004VNJ0T4	The Day Lincoln Was Shot (Tvm)	A History of the Assassination	The Day Lincoln Was Shot, 1998 film<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln and his wife went to a play on Good Friday April 13, 1865. So did John Wilkes Booth. This is a history of that event. At the Surratt Boardinghouse men talk about politics. Booth conspires with his men about capturing Lincoln to exchange for Confederate prisoners. Will it work? Booth the actor has lady admirers, he dances in a ballroom. Lincoln is told he needs more security. Secretary of War Stanton arrives with news of the capture of Richmond. Lincoln wants to visit Richmond. He visits Secretary of State Seward who was injured in a carriage accident. Fireworks celebrate the victory. Lincoln asks the band to play “Dixie”, he plans to welcome the rebel states back. Mary Lincoln shows jealousy and spite. Abraham has a dream about his death. [Do people still believe in dreams?]<br /><br />Lincoln signs pardons for condemned Union soldiers. Lincoln’s son tells about his military experiences. Booth learns about the President’s planned visit to the theater that night and makes plans. Lincoln’s Cabinet recommends harsh punishment for the Rebel leaders, but Lincoln does not want more “bloody work”. They plan to reestablish the courts and the mail system. [Note the dirt roads.] Mrs. Surratt is asked to deliver a package. [This makes part of the conspiracy.] Booth breaks up with Lucy. The conspirators plan to strike at the same time. Lincoln and the Rathbones arrive late. The play goes on. Booth arrives at the theater, a man holds his horse. The other conspirators begin their crimes. There is confusion in the theater! Doctors treat Lincoln.<br /><br />Soldiers arrive. Lincoln is moved to the nearest house across the street. Booth’s leg was injured during his dramatic leap to the stage. Stanton order protection for the Cabinet, the city locked down, and everyone in the theater arrested. The doctors say Lincoln is doomed, he can not survive. Dr. Mudd says Booth’s fibula is broken, he must rest. Itrains in Washington. Lincoln dies at 7:22 AM. “Now he belongs to the ages.” Suspects are rounded up. Twelve days later the Garrett farm is surrounded. One soldier shoots Booth inside a burning barn (Booth shaved off his mustache as a disguise). “Useless” is his last word. The ending credits list what happened afterwards. Mary Surratt was hanged even though there was no conclusive proof of her guilt. [Her son escaped to Europe.] Dr. Mudd got four years as an accessory after the fact. Andrew Johnson became the 17th President, Reconstruction had a vindictive policy towards the South.<br /><br />The northern dominated Congress passed high tariffs on imports which increased industrialization in America. New laws liberalized corporations, they grew in power to form a new aristocracy. [Previously the privilege of incorporation and limited liability were only given to businesses that served the public interest, such as water companies, canals, and railroads.] This is a good history lesson but details had to be eliminated to make this movie fit into its allotted time period. You should read the book for the details that were omitted in this movie. What should be the Reconstruction policy? Harsh punishment for rebellion or a welcome for misguided politics? Machiavelli wrote the duty of a leader was not to chose between the good and the bad but between the bad and the worse; this is one example. You can’t please all of the people all of the time. Abolishing slavery punished the big landowners, those who financed the Confederacy would see their bonds worthless. “A rich man’s war but a poor man’s fight” was one description.

He doesn't care, he still loves it, but it's still kind of irritating. Also, the strings are really short. I know it's for boys, but it fit on both my head and my grandma's head, but the strings looked ridiculously short, even on my little brother (who is 7).

12100	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B008BTT4T0	KISSES Milk Chocolate Pumpkin Spice (10-Ounce Bag, Pack of 4)	Pumpkin Spice Flavor with a Kiss of White Chocolate	Despite my parents (or is that to spite them), I love pumpkin – pumpkin pie, pumpkin cookies, pumpkin muffins….  And thanks to my discovery this year, I can add Hershey's Kisses - Pumpkin Spice to the list.<br /><br />The orange and brown striped wrapper looks just like a normal kiss, and the shape is the same as well.  You’d certainly never know that these are something different – until you unwrap them.  Inside the foil, you’ll find an orange covered kiss.  If you bite into it, you’ll discover a small white chocolate core, but most of the candy is made up of the orangey outside layer.<br /><br />And that’s a good thing.  These kisses don’t take much like chocolate but then again white chocolate rarely does.  Instead, they taste just like perfectly spiced pumpkin, and the white chocolate adds a touch of sweetness while letting the pumpkin spice flavor take center stage.  I can pop one in my mouth and taste the delicious cookies or muffins I’ve had in the past.  They melt in your mouth fairly easily, although I find it hard to wait long enough for them to melt.  I’m chewing and swallowing while unwrapping the next one.<br /><br />Which isn’t necessarily a good thing since these kisses aren’t good for you.  9 of these guys have 210 calories, 110 of them from fat.  And there are no nutrients to speak of at all.  What did you expect from candy?<br /><br />This is hardly surprisingly when you take a look at the ingredients.  We've got your sugar, vegetable oil, milk, corn syrup solids, and whey, with less than 2% of a ton of other things that aren't healthy for you either.<br /><br />Hersey’s makes these in the early fall to coincide with Halloween.  That just might be a good thing.  It gives me something to look forward to and it keeps me from eating too many all year round.<br /><br />So, if you like pumpkin, give the Pumpkin Spice Hershey's Kisses a try.  I bet you are unwrapping the second before you’ve completely eaten the first.

10920	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B0058YPG2K	Breaking Bad: Season 4 [Blu-ray]	"The fourth season of ""Breaking Bad"" gets a very good presentation as well as some terrific special features--recommended."	"It's fairly typical to say each season after the first of ""Breaking Bad"" was a game changer but, in this case, the fourth season IS.<br /><br />Blu-ray review (although the contents for the DVD are very much like that for the Blu-ray, they aren't exactly the same). I'd give the season 5 stars but the BD itself 4 because of some transfer issues.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />After the cold blooded murder of Gale  (who Gus had hired to eventually replace Walt and Jessie) the unlikely dynamic duo found themselves once again in demand from an increasingly unhappy Gus who STILL had plans to replace them at some point. The murder of Gus pushes Jessie into a dark place he's been before but never quite so deep. Skylar decides that she and Walt must have a way to funnel the massive amount of money he is making and decides to invest in a business.<br /><br />Walt must find a way to get Jessie back knowing that he NEEDS him in particular to eventually put Gus out of the way. He also realizes that as long as Gus can get access to Jessie he man not need Walt any longer and that will put Walt, Skylar and his son in harm's way as well.<br /><br />Gus makes Jessie feel important and takes him in one of the stunning set pieces of the season to the home of a drug kingpin in Mexico where Gus has plans for ultimately eliminating his competition not realizing that Walt has similiar plans of his own.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />""Breaking Bad"" continues to be one of the best written shows on television and that's saying quite a bit given some of the competition out there both on AMC and other networks. Creator/producer/writer Vince Gilligan continues to craft a dark, compelling TV series. This isn't ""lite"" entertainment by any stretch of the imagination and those looking for something that will entertain without asking difficult questions and taking characters we like and sometimes admire down the road of temptation should look elsewhere.<br /><br />While the Blu-ray doesn'tlook as stunning as I'd hoped, it looks quite good. There are issues with banding that occur and are particularly noticeable in just about every episode. Most of the previous seasons didn't have this issue that I recall (I'll have to take a look at them again to confirm it)which is why it's perplexing that it's a problem here.<br /><br />The 5.1 lossless DTS audio sounds quite nice with good use of directional effects present throughout. Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish for the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The special features are quite nice on this set including videopod casts, commentary tracks (13!) on every episode that are usually quite informative. We also get extended and alternate scenes as well as the ""Inside Breaking Bad"" featurettes. We also get ""Better Call Saul"" commercials from the series, an amusing gag reel and a variety of featurettes on the production of the series. We also get ""uncensored"" versions of episode as well as an extended final episode for the fourth season.<br /><br />The fourth season brings us to the brink with Walt's final descent into the madness of the world he's adopted and the final shot of the episode demonstrates how desperate he is and how that madness consumes him, Jessie and everyone he comes into contact with.<br /><br />Highly recommended."

Ha, amirite?	I purchased two of these and two of them arrived in a timely manner with more than adequate packaging. I put some Celestion Silver series speakers in there, I found that adding speakers to the cabinets really boosted the performance of them as sound enablers. Only complaint would be the hardware, the screws were too skinny for the speakers I had and the sinks for said screws were screwed on instead of sunk into the wood. Maybe there was a reason for that, I'm not a wood/screw/screw sink guy. I've used them at a couple of shows now and have wound up standing on one of them on more than one occasion because hey rock and roll I'll stay up past 10pm, I don't care. Reasonably priced and functional, plenty of speaker cable in place in addition to an easy install for the speakers (I wound up using the hardware from my old cabinet, though).<br /><br />No gypsy curses detected, so A+ in that category.

Like I said, I LOVE this light.  With 200+ reviews I'll keep it brief and explain why, for my purposes, its soooo great.<br /><br />PRICE:  about 1/2 the price of similar model SureFire<br /><br />SIZE:  slides into my MOLLE chest rig loops and is held securely by the clip.  Also fits perfectly in a 9mm magazine pouch.  (hint:  get a double 9mm mag pouch.  One for the light, one for an unsheathed Leatherman Wave)<br /><br />WEIGHT:  very lightweight aluminum<br /><br />POWER:  as bright as a 3 D-cell Maglite<br /><br />BATTERIES:  2 CR123 batteries last longer than AA batteries and output is more consistent than AA.  AA batteries fade out while CR123 batteries will die almost immediately.  (implied task:  carry a spare pair)<br /><br />STROBE: easy to use with 3 quick clicks and won't accidentally turn on strobe function when constant light is needed<br /><br />OTHER:  ON button is recessed so that when I rest my M4 rifle on my chest gear it won't turn on.  Also, can take some rain from the inevitable Pacific NW rainshower.

Chinese Water Ionizer is junk	I was just on  the Internet a few weeks ago and heard complaints about these chinese water ionizers.  These are the Aqua Ionizer by Air, Water and Life that are supposed to be made in the USA but are really made in China.  I bought my unit about 8 months ago and we used it for a while but really didn't notice any difference in our health.  We are active people in our late 40's and we are always looking for ways to make us healthy.  We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price.  We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results.  A friend of my  Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up.  He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam.  He also showed us some other company's products and said they were certified by a USA water quality company and there were several companies like this that guaranteed their products.  Watch out for this company Air, Water and Life and boycott them.

10592	__label2__	4	N	Office Products	B00P9SI8IE	iGearPro Multifunctional Voice Recorder - Portable Rechargeable Digital Audio Dictaphone - MP3 Player (8GB)	More Useful as an MP3 Player than a WAV Recorder	I received a free item to review.  The interface is a little quirky; the multi-use buttons could have been better thought out:  The mode/select button is used a lot and I think would function better as a large round button on the front rather than the small push switch on the side - it would also be more comfortable for both right and left-handed users.  The sliding power side switch lies too flush with the case and the texture doesn’t make for an easy grip – you have to really press and push to move it.  I also don’t like that I can’t select Play directly after adjusting the volume. I have to select Stop first – that’s just bad design.  Selecting and deleting files is not as intuitive as I’d like, but the unit was recognized by Windows 7 easily and the folders can be accessed directly.  While the WAV file bit rate isn’t adequate for serious music recording, the recorder works fine as a scratch pad for saving instrumental or vocal ideas. Frankly it’s neither as full-featured nor useful as my Zoom H2 recorder but they’re at different price points and it’s not really fair to compare.  The MP3 Player mode comes with two “C-Pop” recordings of what sound like male and female Chinese vocalists singing English phonetically. The unit’s built-in speaker is not so useful, but the buds sound quite good. Of the seven EQ presets only 3-4 were noticeably distinct to my ears, including the Dynamic Bass Boost.  Overall it makes a compact little mp3 player with decent sound. But a better design and better recording capability would make it more competitive with other products in this range.

I am not.  I am going to have to go to the Cheats you can find Online and figure out how to get anywhere in this game.  Not their fault.  The Game Boy Advance little compacts are the most beautifully designed pocket games ever made.  Their charge lasts a long time, and the entire unit lasts and lasts.  These little Warioland 4 and Zelda, and Castlevania cartridges are a joy to own.  If you still  have one, hang on to it.  You can still buy a charging unit for not too much $ and too many kids let their parents talk them into trading them for the next new thing.  The parents (too bad) did not apparently play them.  The children were too young to know their value.  I started playing Mario Pinball and Warioland 4 when I was 73.  At  75, besides being an active harpist and trumpet player in community bands....I still play these games.  They are exquisitely created and a joy to have!<br /><br />nancy morse

You can adjust text and spacing in a myriad of ways; outline, borders, spacing, width, etc.  I didn't explore every option, but compared to my other ""average"" labeler it definitely has more features.  -The label tear-off backing is split down the middle to make backing removal easy.  Some labelers don't have this often overlooked frustration saver.  -Can print up to 2 lines of text per label, a space saving feature I use often.    -Printing different languages seems to be a strong suit of this labeler.  It comes with many different fonts with everything from accent marks to umlauts.  -Changing batteries and inserting different label tape is easy and intuitive.  -Uses 6 easy to find AAA batteries.  Seem to lasts quite a while.  -Has auto off, after approximately 5 minutes of no activity.  Minor Cons:  -Doesn't come with an AC adapter, but you can buy one.  -Doesn't come with a case which would be nice for storing or carrying the unit."

Each of these three tubes came in a separate 6-foot long carton stuffed full of paper to keep the styrofoam from knocking around (???). Really!

Unfortunately there is quite a lot of static on both speakers. The amount of static changes depending on where I position the speakers. I guess there are just too many gadgets out there these days that use this frequency band which makes it hard for these speakers to compete.

Theirs was made in Japan and they had to hire someone to install. The BIDET4ME E-300Al was very simple to install. Also the shape of this model was aesthetically pleasing to the eye compared to their model which is used in nursing homes. It appeared thinner and sleeker.<br /><br />Very Easy to controls and use. Setting on warm temperature, and width of stream very convenient. I opted for the model over the 350 because I wanted the dryer function, which works well enough, but I find myself sitting up before the dryer time is up and using paper.<br /><br />This is very worthwhile purchase. I almost can't live without it.  =)

Striking a near-perfect balance between grit and sensationalism, it takes viewers through a world marked by violence, double-dealing, and racial division, with an emphasis on the ambiguous morality and personal and familial baggage that come with a life lived between the straight world and the criminal one.

No, actually seriously, almost. I just googled their website and they have their contact info all right there; I emailed and explained the issue.

I have chronic back problems and my work requires sitting most of the day so this chair takes a lot of the pressure off my back.  It does put more pressure on my knees but that is better than on my back.  My only complaint is that the rubber trim on the back support comes off and the adjustment knob underneath came apart.  I didn't really need the knob so I just left it off and I glued the trim back on the back support.

I could have sworn when I placed these on my wish list a while back that it stated the set included lunch plates. When I received the set this Christmas, I opened the box to find bread & butter sized plates, as the outside of the box does state. These are not large enough for a sandwich, but could pass as a small dessert plate. I came back to amazon.com to see what the description states, and it does now state b&b plates, so maybe I was just imagining it? But I think that it originally did list lunch plates and that it was recently edited. It's the lunch plates that I needed the most. :-(

2776	__label1__	2	N	Office Products	B0091Y07Y0	Epson Expression Premium XP-600 Small-in-One® Printer - Epson C11CC47201	Expensive to operate, and eventually flaky and unusable	"I bought this unit for my family because:<br />- it was very attractive and low profile so it could sit in on our kitchen area desk and be very unobtrusive<br />- I wanted good quality photo prints on the occasions that I did those things<br />- I wanted good quality scans<br /><br />On all accounts above it looked and worked great.<br /><br />I also used it wirelessly on a reserved ip address (where it would always boot to that address), and again it was mostly flawless on that account.<br /><br />Now for THE BIG DOWNSIDES:<br />- ink is super expensive for daily printing of our kid's reports, etc and the cartridges are insultingly small in small capacity and large in cost<br />- constantly annoyed at always having to go back to the ""advanced"" dialog menu to change printing from color (expensive) to black and white (can't seem to make black and white default stick - I wonder why!)<br />- can only use Epson $$$ cartridges (electronically keyed or something as opposed to my old brother mfc-j630w that you can fill with generic ink once you buy the  refillable cartridges)<br />- I still ended up with problems only using the expensive Epson ink ordered directly from them (problems not initially, but later) when my perfectly fine original manufacturer cartridges stopped working (print gaps) even though they were almost new, and then in head cleaning or alignment to try and get a cartridge working again it would often tell me it no longer recognized some of the other cartridges that had previously be reported as near full, and that were previously printing fine, but now suddenly the printer had a problem with them?!<br /><br />In the end I wasted far too much of my time (and anguish) trying to get this thing to print again.<br /><br />My advice : stay away from this model (and probably this brand), because even when you buy, buy, buy into their eco-system, you could still end up with the problems I had, and waste a whole lot of money, your time, and get a lot of frustration trying to fix some unfixable problems.<br /><br />Threw the whole unit into the garbage, and went back to using my old brother mfc-j630w, which I got back up and working in less than 30 min.<br /><br />Sure the brother doesn't scan as well, doesn't look as nice, and doesn't quite print photos as well, but when I want to print something, it darned well prints, and quickly as opposed to that frustrating slow and often flaky Epson (that worked so nicely at the beginning and then became a demon).<br /><br />Now I'm happily printing on command, and much, much, more cheaply using my brother.<br /><br />Glad to be done with the Epson demon.<br /><br />Don't think I'm some industry person writing a negative review - I'm a real guy, who is pretty darn technically competent, but I'm just sick of wasting my time and energy on stuff that doesn't work - and I really, really wanted to Epson to work on many accounts, but finally just gave up and threw away a frustratingly unusable piece of gear (and a fair amount of money in gear and unusable cartridges)."

I have no idea why it's so slow, but if I had to do it over I probably would buy a gaming device or pay a little more for something faster. I just sit and sit, waiting for the screens to come up, and every single time I fire up Netflix it has to go through some 3-course check to see if it has an Internet connection. Why?

Other than that, we love it.

Seriously, how does a company turn a profit at back to school time with one cent boxes of pencils?<br /><br />I always buy Staedtler when I can. Their products last longer and produce better results. You can feel the quality in your hand and it is even more evident when you have to erase. Most companies go out of their way to make things dirt cheap but Staedtler goes above and beyond to make sure their products can't be beat. You really will get what you pay for.

4157	__label1__	5	Y	Wireless	B00E4CX5Y8	PBS Smart 7000 mAh External Battery Pack Portable Power Bank Charger - Retail Packaging - White	Battery is great to have as backup	Used to be when I'd travel by plane, I'd bring a book, a stack of magazines, a large bottle of water and of course, I able to wear shoes with laces. Obviously, there's a new world order and traveling means I have to stay in touch with everyone at all times! Besides hauling my Mac Book, I now bring my iPhone, iPad, slide on shoes and because of TSA restrictions, no water bottle.<br /><br />I'm not phased by dehydration. Like most travelers, my fear of all fears, is that my electronics will lose their power, while in midair! I get the shakes at being left with no phone to tell my family, friends and colleagues that I'm waiting on a line or bored. I also shudder at having no books, magazines or emails from work to read. After all, without any power, I am a broken man - dehydrated, staring at my slip ons.<br /><br />I'd heard that external batteries were an option but thought they were expensive, bulky and not dependable. After hearing my son Alex rave about his battery pack, I decided to read some independent reviews and take a cyber stroll to Amazon. Review after review highlighted PBS's superb quality, reliability and features. However, my foremost reason for going with PBS was their excellent customer service. I noticed that if in fact there was a negative review, Anker remedied each and every malady. As a result of my research, I decided to order the PBS, PBS Smart 7000mAh External Battery Pack  for $35.99, at Amazon.

The day spent with this machine is pleasant since the car's air is as clear as mountain air even after I brought some heavy odor food. My car does not have the stale food odor with heavy layer of outside air pollution. I would recommend it if you find your car's air unsatisfying to your nose.
11085	__label2__	4	N	Beauty	B00ON1VGZK	Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator, 1 Ounce	Might Be the Solution to Your/Your Child's Blemishes ...	As with most blemish fighting products, do expect a little dryness and maybe (if overused) some very minor peeling. And, as is customary, do try to begin using it every other day (or even every third day if your skin is already a little dry) and then increase the frequency of use incrementally. While there is a smell that might seem slightly off-putting, the results more than compensate for any initial discomfort. On the positive side, it leave skin soft and touchable.    Now, it is a little pricy. But, if less expensive products have seemed to fail, this might be a great moderately price system.    Like all similar lines, try it. Commit to it for about six-months. If you or your child does not see a noticeable difference, experiment with a different system or consult your physician.

I start and end my day with a glass of tea more often than not. The yogi java herbal tea is one of my favorites. It tastes good and I know it's good for me which just makes it that much better. The flavor is great and the feelings of relief are wonderful after a long, hard day of work.<br /><br />My greatest feeling comes when I add 5-htp and melatonin ([[ASIN:B00CBE7IDU Melatonin 5 mg - 180 Capsules + FREE 5-HTP 100 mg - 60 Capsules]]) to the tea though; talk about an overwhelming calm! All the stress from my day is immediately wiped away when I use this blend! The flavor of the yogi and power mixed with those supplements gives me the ultimate rush of content. I feel so balanced when I have a glass of tea using those that it's almost intoxicating. The feelings are so hard to put into words.<br /><br />A bag of the tea is the perfect amount of flavor for my glass, with a little of each powder it's like a calm bliss. None of the day's baggage seems relevant anymore. I love that feeling. My mood is instantly improved and I am able to sleep soundly knowing I have the stress off my shoulders for the time being. It's a great way to enhance your overall well being. I suggest the blend to any natural tea lover like me!

Needless to say this one is still in the box as a ready standby.<br /><br />You may not have had a decent cup of coffee if you have never had one in this coffee maker. The difference I understand to be not only that it has the added water filter and permanent screen filter, but that it runs the hot water through the coffee very quickly so you're not getting all of the bitterness that you get from slower operating units. It makes a pot of coffee in about the third of the time a normal store-bought unit.

18963	__label2__	5	Y	Baby	B007CRJHXU	babyletto Hudson 3-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Grey	As good as an Oeuf at half the price	I love the Oeuf Sparrow crib yet couldn't bring myself to spend $800+ on a baby bed. I searched everywhere for a grey crib with a modern ascetic. I finally came across this Hudson crib and knew it was the one. My son's name happens to be Hudson making it that much more fitting. The wood is sturdy and of very good quality. The grey color is beautiful, although a little lighter than the Oeuf.  The open slats on all four sides make it airy and comfortable for baby. It took us about an hour to put together and we had no problems. There are 4 different mattress height options. The crib sits low to the ground which makes it easier to get baby in and out without breaking your back.  It comes with the toddler rail which is an added bonus. You have to buy it extra with the Oeuf at $200+. I am so happy that I found this crib. I would recommend it to any family.<br /><br />UPDATE: At 18 months my son figured out how to crawl out of the crib. I was so glad we already had the toddler rail as we had to do a quick change late one night to prevent my little guy from breaking his neck. It was beyond easy to unscrew the front panel of the crib and attach the toddler rail. It took us all of 10 minutes. It's a huge transition from the crib to toddler bed (for both baby and parents) but it was made so much easier because we could continue to use the crib he'd been sleeping in from the beginning. I am still so glad that I chose the Hudson crib over the Oeuf. It has held up very well and is in great condition after almost two years. I expect that we will continue to use it for at least another year or so.

20182	__label2__	4	Y	Jewelry	B000PVEN48	Twisted Spiral with Chain and Ball Drop Dangle Sterling Silver Hook Earrings	Cute but easily tangled	I really like these earrings because they are a great length (not too long but enough to stand out) and very lightweight.  I get lots of compliments on them.  My only complaint is they get tangled easily when not in use, in fact they arrived tangled.  So I just store them carefully and it seems to have solved the problem.
16891	__label2__	1	N	PC	B00DVFLJDS	Nexus 7 from Google (7-Inch, 16 GB, Black) by ASUS (2013) Tablet	2013 Asus Nexus 7 is awesome but very fragile - BEWARE	The 2013 Asus Nexus 7 is absolutely awesome when it works.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is also very fragile. I bought one right before a trip and was loving it until 2/3 of the digitizer went intermittent then quit working. After looking at it under various lighting conditions while it was off, I could see a hair line crack in the display/digitzer stack. The fracture was not visible with the display on. You could not feel it on the surface. The digitizer worked on the narrow side of the crack and not on the other two thirds of the screen.<br />This device is too fragile. The chassis flexes easily and I believe this is what allows the display to flex enough to break the digitizer. I feel like this product is going to have major issues because it is small enough to fit in a pocket like a large cell phone and based on the amount of flex in the chassis, this is the kiss of death for a nexus 7. For anyone considering buying a 2013 Nexus 7, put it in a nice fat rigid case immediately and never, never subject it to any flex.<br /><br />I think Asus should take a look at an a Samsung note 2. I have carried one for a year and not been nearly as careful, and it is holding up fine, granted it is smaller, but the 2013 nexus 7 lasted 3 days and the repair cost (165.00 for a screen that you install) The repair cost is too expensive to make sense and turns an awesome device into land fill fodder. What sucks is that I feel responsible for breaking it although it was never dropped or handled roughly, and from the posts around the web, I can tell that it is a waste of time to try to get Asus to stand behind their product even though it is three days old.<br /><br />As much as I hate to sound like a Apple fan boy, at least you can fix an ipad digitizer for 30 bucks if you are willing to burn an hour or two. Asus, it is going to very difficult to convince myself to carry another 2013 Nexus 7. I expect it to work when I turn it on....

17466	__label2__	5	Y	Office Products	B00HNCNT0G	Chalk Ink Markers - NEON Set (8-pack), BEST Chalk Ink Pens for Dry Erase Boards, Blackboards, Whiteboards, Mirrors, Car Windows & Decorating in Colors	Great marker	First, let me warn you about the instructions of the markers. When I got them I was so excited that I opened the package without hesitation. I used one and nothing happened, no ink, no nothing; and I thought &#34;they don't work!&#34; and then, I had an aha moment when I saw the instructions on the marker! The steps are so easy to follow that even my 3 year old daughter was helping me with the first two. So make sure to read the instructions to initiate the flow of the ink.<br /><br />I like the chisel tip to make broad and fine lines. They don't squeak.<br /><br />The markers were just as expected, and they are great quality. They also arrived two days earlier than expected!<br />The color is vibrant and really stands out. And they don't have a strong odor that can give you a headache. And because of that I let my daughter use them on her mirror. She couldn't believe me when I told her to do that (because that doesn't happen around here), she ran as fast as she could before I change my mind!<br /><br />I can use them on my Pyrex to make sure someone won't take it by mistake at gatherings, or for my &#34;to do list&#34; just in case I loose the paper version, or my daughter might think daddy's car needs some color! So many things.....<br />The only color I wish they have is purple, my daughter's favorite color! We ended up using red and blue and voila, purple!<br />But over all, I LOVE them!<br /><br />I should say to use caution when replacing the cap as it can catch on the marker top and mash it. My daughter did that to a couple of them.

14558	__label2__	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B005CSTHPY	Brinkmann 815-4005-S Outdoor Cooker Stand	Excellent price and quality	I purchased this burner and got the next day $3.99 shipping through prime so I could brew a batch quickly...not disappointed at all!<br /><br />The assembly was easy and quick. It is sturdy and man...does it kick out some heat. I didn't need to push it all the way for my purposes. I used about 1/2 power and had 8 gallons of hose water boiling in 24 minutes! That was with a lid on.<br /><br />When it came time to boil my wort, it worked great. I didn't time it, but it was quickly up to boiling, and I had about 7.5 gallons going. It could easily handle more, I just don't have a pot big enough to test it.<br /><br />The great part is that there is room to grow with this burner. I have a 9 gallon pot that is pretty wide, and I have the adjustable base set to the narrowest setting. I could get a 15 to 20 gallon pot on top of this burner very safely. It is rock solid and can handle a lot of weight.<br /><br />The wind baffles work well, too. It was a relatively windy day, and I was able to adjust the baffles with tilt to keep the wind from affecting the flame too much.<br /><br />I can't tell how much propane it is using up yet, as I have only one batch under my belt, but my calculations tell me that at 105,000 BTU, you will burn through a standard 20 lb. propane tank in 4 hours. As I said, I was probably going half power on the first batch, since I was getting used to the burner...so I plan on 6 to 8 hours of burn time per tank. Time will tell.

Great hitch but the first time I used it in the rain it seemed like the grease washed off and I had galling of the moving parts and excessive noise while turning.  I had to loosen the bolts holding the spring bar sockets and clean the mating surfaces as best I could and re-lubricate.  I used motorcycle chain lube because it starts out thin to gets between the working surfaces and then thickens to a high pressure water resistant grease after the solvent flashes off.  Somewhat disappointed that I would have to perform such maintenance thus 4 stars.  Seller deserves 5 stars; hitch arrived on time in good condition.

11399	__label2__	4	N	Home Improvement	B00IJHHPQ8	Moen Moen GA821 Moen rinse basket, Stainless	This has two uses for me - a high quality rinse basket and a counter-top dish drainer with my dish drying mats underneath	"I never use my dishwasher because I prefer to hand wash my dishes.  Since my sink is pretty big, this has been working perfectly during the rare times when I want to use a rinse basket to drain the dishes before I dry them.  It has also been working very well as a counter-top dish drying rack as long as I put a drying mat underneath (since it does not come with a drain board).  I never liked dish drainers so I use a drying mat similar to [[ASIN:B004M0P34M The OriginalTM Dish Drying Mat XL Microfiber Absorbent Machine Washable Fast Drying 18""X24"" Multipurpose Extra Large]].  However, sometimes I wash so many dishes that they don't fit on the mat. With this rack, I can get 8 large fiesta dinner dishes and a couple of small bowls upright so that I don't have to wash the dishes in shifts.  I also sometimes wash the dishes and put them in the rinse basket and let them drain before putting the entire contraption with dishes on the drying mat.<br /><br />This rinse basket arrived in a box with no instructions to say what material it was made of, the measurements of the basket, or where to return for a replacement should the rack fail. The Amazon page says it's a stainless finish and has a 1-year warranty. The measurements on the Amazon page say it fits a bowl size that is 14 x 16  with center drain.  I would say that is correct since the rack measures 15 inches wide from front to back (long wise), 12 inches wide from side to side (width wise) at the widest point, and 6-1/2 inches high if I count the feet.  The feet are rubberized so that it does not slip around in the sink.<br /><br />My sink is 8 inches deep, 21-1/2 inches wide from left to right, and 17 inches wide from front to back (18-1/2 wide if I count the notch on the left).  I use this on the right side of my (single-bowl) sink and wash on the left side. I then store this in the top rack of my dishwasher within easy reach for when I want to use it again.  I could leave it in the sink but I do not always wash so many dishes at once. However, if I had side-by-side sinks, I would leave this in the sink.<br /><br />The unit feels very sturdy, is really nice looking, and what I consider a 5-star product.  The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because of the following:<br /><br />- Utensils fall through the rack as there is no utensil basket.  I could use my dishwasher utensil basket but that would take up valuable space in this rack.<br /><br />- I consider the current price of $63.75 a bit steep for a rinse basket.  However, if this lasts for life then it's cheap. Only time will tell if this lasts and does not rust; I will update my review if I encounter any problems.<br /><br />- The lack of an information sheet with the product description and warranty information is mildly disappointing.<br /><br />Other than this, I feel this basket is high quality and perfect as a rinse basket.  It is even more useful for me because I also use it as a counter-top dish drainer."

14966	__label2__	4	Y	Kitchen	B00OXZBA6Q	FP Coffee Maker French Press Coffee Maker w/ Glass Carafe and Sturdy Metal Frame: 34 oz (8 cup) capacity; smooth plunger, fine mesh filter, sturdy handle and frame, dishwasher safe parts.	Quality French Press With NO Plastic Interior Parts	I've been using my FP french press for about 3 weeks now. This is my first time making coffee in a french press and really, my first time making coffee for myself beyond using a Keurig.  I love the concept of a french press and the taste this one produces is quite nice compared to other methods I've tasted.  This FP is larger than I expected and as the only person using it my home, I wish I had purchased a smaller one, but I suppose it will be useful when having guests.  What I didn't realize with making your own coffee is the need to use a 1/4 cup of grounds just to produce one 12 oz cup of coffee.  Why do all these companies consider 1 cup to be 4 oz.? Who drinks 4 oz. of coffee unless it's an espresso???? I find that a little misleading.  Secondly, it doesn't keep the coffee hot enough for more than 5 minutes.  Understandably so since it is glass.  I realize if I wanted to keep it hotter longer, I probably should have bought an insulated all stainless steel FP, but I wanted to be able to see it brewing.  To deal with that issue, I just try to time it properly.  Overall, this french press seems like good quality. I like its simple, streamlined design. No plastic parts on interior touching hot water and the metal mesh works well at keeping stray grounds out of my coffee. I find it easy enough to clean and feel like the glass will hold up well. If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.

I have three cordless drills that are pretty cheap and was getting sick and tired of the batteries always dieing in the middle of my projects which is a pain in the rear and very frustrating....also a lot of money in batteries. I dont mind an extension cord because i'm usually working in one place at home so not a hassle there. My only problem with the drill is the vsr. It goes from 0 to 2500 rpm way too fast and there isnt much &#34;in between&#34; rpm. So be carefull when driving screws because its very easy to go too deep. I still like it though and would recommend to anyone that needs a good drill for a long time.
10248	__label1__	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B0088IGPM8	XIOS DS Streaming Media Player for TVs (with XBMC capability)	Awesome product - wish everthing I bought is as good!!!	I purchased a XIOS DS Media Play to be able to stream using XBMC from my bedroom TV.  Since the main purpose of the box was to run XBMC, I decided to install the Linux version of XBMC (you will need a micro SD card to update the firmware).  Running Linux XBMC seems to offer a much smoother experience than the android version and is highly recommended.  Installation of 3rd party video addons and the syncing of my media libraries was quite easy.  A keyboard is recommended for the set up process as it would save time (typing network passwords or adding sources).<br /><br />The XIOS plays everything I have in my library without stutter over the network (H.264, WMV, AVI, MKV, MPEG, RMVB, MOV, FLV files up to 1080p over a wired connection).  The box is not your standard plug and play media player and will require a little bit of set up to get the most out of the unit.  However, with instructions for firmware installation and XBMC setup being on the Pivos forums, this was not an issue for me.<br /><br />Very Satisfied... Keep up the good work!

Then that night during the firmware update, the wireless network stopped working.  I  tried everything to get it working without success. I called Vizio support andn worked with them for over an hour and we could not get the wireless connection to work.  They sent our a repairman in about a week and a half and they changed a board in the TV.  When the repairman left the wireless network was working fine.  Again that night when the TV did the firmware upgrade, the wireless network stopped working.  After trying a bunch of different ways to resolve the problem, I determined that it would work on WEP network and on a plain WPA network connection but not on the more secure WPA-PSK encryption network I and running.  Vizio indicated that I would need to downgrade my network security to get the wireless network to function with the TV.  I'm not going to downgrade my network for a TV, so I returned the TV an purcahsed a LG 47LW5600 that works just fine on my existing network.

1863	__label1__	4	Y	Home Improvement	B0013C6SHS	Swanstone QZAD-3322.077 33-Inch by 22-Inch Drop-In Ascend Bowl Kitchen Sink, Nero	Fantastically functional and stylish	I purchased the Nero sink and get lots of oohs and ahhs over its unique styling. The color is a deep charcoal, but not black. The material seems very durable and hasn't scratched at all yet (2 months). I was a little worried that the texture of the surface (which is about the texture of the inside of an iron skillet) might hold food particles, but that hasn't really been an issue.<br /><br />My only concern is that the guidance on cleaning from the swanstone company pretty much eliminates every cleaner on the market. No bleach and no ammonia? Almost everything has at least one of these. Without either of these, you are pretty much out of choices. That said, I have found a very successful cleaning ritual. I start with  warm water/dish soap/scrubbing sponge and finish with a wipe down with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and this seems to do a great job. I am a fan of bleach, so I do miss the sense of clean the burning odor of bleach gives, but don;t want to risk hazing up the finish.<br /><br />18 MONTH UPDATE. The finish on this sink remains flawless which I find very impressive. I have found a good cleaning routine as well. I use dish soap (e.g. Dawn) and a scrubbing sponge with very hot water most of the time. If it looks like ti needs a a little extra care, I follow that with a granite cleaner and polish. I go about 3 months between polishing and it still looks like the day I installed it.

That doesn't really bother me. What bothers me is that I spent money on something that doesn't actually work the way the advertisement said it would. It was a huge struggle to huge and I don't have any intention of recommending this to anyone. Or using it again, for that matter.

12743	__label2__	5	Y	Automotive	B007USCMJM	A/C PRO (ACP-102) PRO Professional Formula R-134a Ultra Synthetic Air Conditioning Refrigerant Refill - 12 oz.	The best I have found	Car A/C uses an open compressor, which actually leak from new.  As the car gets older, it leaks more until the gas and oil loss which leaks with it becomes unacceptable.<br /><br />After 30 years in A/C work, this is the best home kit I have found.<br /><br />The gage is accurate so I don't have to drag my manifold gages out, and the gas and oil is top notch.<br /><br />My KIA is ten years old and the A/C actually works better, and smoother (noticeably smoother idle when the A/C is on) than it has in years.<br /><br />If you have a really bad compressor seal, this won't help for long, but there is only one way to find out.<br /><br />It may be more costly than other brands and/or kits, but I love A/C in the summer.<br /><br />As stated, this is just the re-fill and you will need the kit with the hose and gage.

Yes, it's a bit heavy, but it won't fall down and with the shoes that come with it you can shoot on a sandy or slicky beach, even put the tripod on rocks, if you have to to get the shot, without worrying too much, though I'd worry anyway, can't help myself.<br /><br />This is also my first Vanguard tripod and after having used it for awhile now, I don't know why I haven't had one before, because it's apparent to me now that Vanguard is a company with photographers on their mind.

4031	__label1__	1	Y	Tools	B00AFI4PN0	ARKSEN© 4 in 1 1500W Watt Quartz Infrared Heater Fan Humidifier Portable- Cherry	Extremely disappointed	After weeks of browsing and going back and forth between other products, deciding which infrared space heater to get in this style, I ordered this one and finally received it yesterday. I liked the fact that it has the air purifier AND humidifier built in, I was excited to use it to help lower my gas heating bill. It seemed to have pretty good reviews and I hoped it would work the same for me. But it did not.<br />It did not appear to be defective, it turned on and after a &#34;heat-up&#34; period it started blowing at &#34;full power&#34;. I placed it in a 12x14 room (8 foot ceiling) where my main furnace thermostat is located. The temperature on the furnace thermostat was set at 64 degrees. I wanted to see how much the room temp could be raised with this new heater so the furnace would not kick on. I left the heater running for FIVE HOURS non-stop. The room temperature would not rise over the 64 degrees and the furnace still kicked on even with the heater running. Maybe this one is just a dud, who knows. I have an old small Lasko ceramic heater that outputs more heat than this thing...<br />I have asked for a refund but because I bought from a third party seller (something I usually NEVER do) it will probably be a big hassle if they even agree to a refund and will probably end up costing me more to ship back than the item is worth :(

Hey, if it can calm my high-functioning autistic kid, I am all for it. I say six and up. Tin is of good quality. 7"" tall. We have the middle one in the top row; it has sweet birds and flowers printed on the cat's chest, back, and butt, retro-style (not as weird as it sounds). Throw away your rabbit's foot, your four-leaf clover, your ratty Dakin hedgehog stuffed animal resting on your pillow, your mate's toenails clippings, and get this instead.<br /><br />*Cat is actually beckoning, which is fine with me too.<br /><br />Top row, left to right:<br />Dream kitty, friendship kitty, peace kitty.<br /><br />Bottom row, same:<br />Happiness kitty, love kitty (hearts on body), serenity kitty.<br /><br />Update (7/11/12): I just discovered that if you lay the kitty on its back that it will stop waving...this is easier than stopping the arm."

11593	__label2__	4	Y	Books	0785192336	X-Men Volume 4: Exogenous (Marvel Now)	Space Adventure for the X-Men	Collecting: X-Men (2013) #18-22<br /><br />In the previous adventure, [[ASIN:0785189726 X-Men Volume 3: Bloodline]], the all-female X-Men's adventure was rooted firmly on planet earth.  In this book, the ladies are in space.  Earth's space based defense agency (SWORD) is under attack after Deathbird is rescued.  A crazy group of gene-splicing aliens called the Providian Order have made custom bad guys out of Brood and Skrull warriors. They will stop at nothing to take Deathbird back with them.<br /><br />The Providian Order's minions aren't the only ones hunting Deathbird.  The Shi'ar become unlikely allies of the X-Men as Rachel Grey's family history collides with that of one of Shi'ar counselors.  I was glad to see Rachel's past getting a little more development in these issues because she is a strong character.<br /><br />These issues create a self-contained story, so readers can pick this volume up without reading the prior episode and they won't have to wait until the next installment for the conclusion.  This all-female has a great line up that includes Storm, Psylocke, and Rachel Grey, And the 'all-female' angle seems to promise something different for an X-team.  Unfortunately, the all-female team engages in pretty run-of-the-mill superhero adventures.  That is to say, while the premise of an all-female casts promises something unique, this comic delivers a pretty standard plot.<br /><br />If you like X-Men and especially if you like X-Women, this volume will appeal to you.  There is plenty of action and outer space excitement.  I keep waiting for that 'something special' that really defines a female x-team, but I never quite get it.  I will continue following this series because I really enjoy the characters and the idea behind the group has tremendous promise.  The next adventure for this X-team can be found in [[ASIN:0785197265 X-Men Vol. 5: The Burning World]]

17640	__label2__	5	Y	Home	B0045H737W	Madison Park Athena 6 Piece Jacquard Duvet Set, King, Blue	Surprisingly luxurious...	After getting burned a couple of times buying bedding online, I thought I'd take one last stab at it after a disappointing day of shopping all over town. I was pleasantly surprised with this set! Yes, it is polyester, but does not feel or breath like it. The top of the duvet is rich and satiny, and not in that shiny, cheap, scratchy way. The underside has almost a sueded feel,  moves well with the sheet and is very soft to the touch. If I was pressured, I might say that the fabric was a little thin, but with a hefty down comforter inside, it is quite warm and seems much more expensive than what I paid. The throws are also equally high quality, though one arrived a bit lumpy. The pattern is GORGEOUS, and I felt that the picture was very accurate in color. It's a very pale blue/seafoam and the pattern is white and taupe. The picture does NOT do the decoration justice...it looks quite expensive.

This is my first purchase of &#34;crystal balloons&#34; so maybe I am expecting too much (aka THE IMPOSSIBLE), but I was surprised to see them go from crystal to solid within a few hours. Had I not taken pictures as soon I was done inflating them, I would not have believed they were ever crystal to start with.<br />That being my disappointment, I was otherwise satisfied with the quality and color assortment. Although I should mention that due to the amount of colors included, the amount of each individual color was random: I counted 29 red, 21 orange, 18 green. (There were other colors as well-blue, yellow, crystal clear). So if you intend to make colorful &#34;patterns&#34; this might not be the best buy for you.

The same HDTV will see 47 channels in the living room including all free HD stations (which is really what I want) but only 30-33 stations in the bedroom.  I had high hopes for this unit, but it only improved the signal enough for the TV to recognize 36 (3-6 more) channels in the bedroom.  Unfortunately I'm still not getting the stations I really want.  Even still, I might keep and use the unit because I think it would boost the signal enough to help with some of the flakier stations in the living room, but it runs really hot and doesn't work at all when it's not plugged in (so I can't unplug it when I leave the house without disabling my webcam).  So I'm very disappointed and will look for other solutions.  It's possible I got a defective unit.

14342	__label2__	3	Y	Musical Instruments	B0043GL0A6	40 Inch Hand Painted Rain Stick Percussion Rainstick	Not the best quality.	Over all, its okay. The wooden pegs do poke out. they were not sanded down at all and it gives the bamboo a rough feeling. One of the pegs was also missing when I opened the packaging which allowed some of the material to slip out of the rainstick.. I had a bamboo skewer stick that fit into the hole snugly. There was also a pretty big indentation in the middle of the rainstick. At first I thought it was damaged in shipping but upon closer inspection it seems to be where they filled it from and set some sort of plug there.  The sound from this rainstick is okay. when tipped slowly it sounds good, but any more than a moderate cascade and it does sound &#34;off&#34;. For the money I can't complain as its intended for light use.

However, it can't really take the place of formal testing at your county agricultural office.

When I finally understood the instructions to put the gate together, it went up and was in place in minutes. (I'm trying to keep my Bichon Frise puppy off of the carpet until she is potty trained.)  Was working in another room, and there she was beside me wanting to help.  I checked, and the gate was closed.  Found she is small enough to get between the bars - all hair and tiny body! Wrapped each section with plastic wrap.  She learned in a few hours how to remove the wrap.  Now the wrap is taped with packing tape.  A day later, it is still working fine!  The bars are too far apart for small puppies.

Then this ridiculous seller told me that I probably damaged it somehow when I was trying to figure out what went wrong and said I would have to purchase a new one. Do not buy from him! he does not stand behind his product.<br /><br />On top of this, the product was oozing some weird glue stuff out of it which should have tipped me off that it was an inferior product. I would never recommend this crappy seller to anyone. I hope anyone else reading this will learn from my mistake and not purchase this!

19771	__label2__	1	Y	Luggage	B004BQIZLU	Delsey Luggage Helium Lightweight Garment Sleeve Trolley, Black, 42 Inch	Great Bag Design, Smells Just Awful	My husband has two suits that he travels with, and we wanted a sturdy garment back to pack and store. I really wanted this to solve that problem but alas.<br /><br />First, the good: The size is just right for a suit and a dress shirt or two, at about 42&#34; long. The exterior pockets can hold a pair of shoes, ties, socks and a belt. It's a bit bulky to put in an overnight suitcase, so he just carried it in that case; when he used his larger suitcase, he was able to fit it. The fabric was substantial, the zippers pretty good.<br /><br />Now, the bad: When I opened the package, I was hit by this godawful chemical smell. There was even a little placard with the Delsey tags that said it had been treated with chemicals that the European governing bodies has identified as a potentially cancer causing agent. Uh, ooooooooookay.... Still, my husband really liked them so we agreed to air them out for a week, which dissipated the smell some; also we'd hang it in our storage closet with our winter coats rather than our regular clothes. However, the time when he traveled with the bag packed in the larger suitcase, it smelled up all his clothes and he reeked of chemical BO on that trip. And when we got back from that trip, we realized that the winter coats in the closet had absorbed the smell so now we've got to air out all those from whatever is on this thing.<br /><br />So, in sum, out they go. It's too bad -  if it weren't for the cancer chemicals, these would have been perfect!

8845	__label1__	5	N	Camera	B007HZC84M	Listen Through Walls Professional Device	A bit pricey, but excellent quality.	A bit pricey, but excellent quality. Made in Japan, so it's not just some cheap Chinese knock-off. The mic is very sensitive and the amplifier seems calibrated to accentuate voice frequencies specifically, though I can't be sure. Anyway, the voices come through pretty clear, at least through the brick wall I tried it on. Having the mic on a cord (about two feet) is great because you can just tape the microphone to the wall and not have to hold it tight against it all the time. Haven't tried recording yet, but should be possible to have it record to my laptop with the right connector. The outlet on the device is 3.5mm female plug, and so is the microphone plug on the laptop, so it would have to be a 3.5mm male to male cable...
7349	__label1__	5	Y	Apparel	B00ZRXLBIK	Buttons & Pleats The Best Shirt Stays Advanced Type Straight Style	Easy and Strong	As good as advertised if not better. The shirt stays don't come undone no matter what you do. No damage at all to shirts. Really impressed with how these are constructed from all aspects. Very good metal but not too heavy so they are comfy and light. You can tell when you squeeze them how strong they are and that they're going to hold up without breaking. The nylon covers on the insides keep hold of the shirt and don't leave marks. The elastic is soft and doesn't yank on my leg hair. That's a problem I thought I'd always have with shirt stays, but these ones don't do it at all. Big improvement over what I was using before. Even easy to get on despite how hard they grip. Whoever designed these did a really good job. They thought of everything.
17473	__label2__	4	Y	Grocery	B002GWHCNS	Coffee Bean Direct Indian Monsooned Malabar, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag	Optimal for Cappuccino, Espresso Machines (UPDATE: Be Aware of Roast Date!)	"*** Updated Review:  Be Aware of Roast Date to avoid older roast date Beans.  Coffee Beans are to be enjoyed when they are fresh roasted.  They are a perishable product that can go stale.    I have been subscribing to this product, and have often being sent older stored roasted date beans.  Fresh roasted coffee beans reach their ""peak"" at about 2 weeks after roasting, and diminish from there.  My last shipment was 3 month old beans under my 'Subscribe and Save'.  The original beans are quite good, but no longer being 'fresh roasted' by the time I receive them was disappointing   I had to discontinue the Subscribe and Save as a result of this...    How to read a Coffee Bean Direct Date Code at the bottom of 5lb bag:  First off, the ""Expiration Date"" is exactly 1 year from the Roast/Packing Date.    Second, the date code is written as such: (example) ""26714.02 ""  EQUALS ""267""th day of year (20)""14"" . batch ""02"".  267th day of year is Sept 24th; 14 is year 2014; .02 is 2nd batch of day....    Being sent 3 month old beans is the fault of warehouse inventory control.  I believe the vendor does freshly pack his beans, and sends to Amazon warehouse.  Then Amazon stockpiles it into warehouse storage, and ships out older stockpiles...  I really want freshest roast date product, so I have to again change vendor sources...    **** Original Review***  I have been using Malabar Monsooned beans for about 8 Years, and I am glad to have this new source to choose from.  I feel that monsooned malabar is optimal for Cappuccinos, as its smoothness complements micro-foamed milk quite well.  My first pull from this new order had a very nice crema, dark golden colored as hoped for and expected. Smooth and rich.  City Roasted, roasted till the first crack and allowed to rest before finishing, had the characteristics I wanted, not too darkly roasted...  So for people who want to grind their beans via a burr grinder, and pull a golden shot via their dialed in espresso machine, I can recommend this.  I don't use this for drip coffee, so I can't comment on that, but this makes a pretty good cappuccino via my Gaggia Classic.  4.25 Stars"

The harness sold to me by iJDM is perfect as it is exactly what I need. It could be used as an extension or a replacement for your factory harness. My only gripe about the harness I received, is the wire wasn't crimped perfectly so there is live cable exposed. On the plus side, I like how there is a rubber grommet at the male end to give it a snug fit into the bulb. So the harness does everything that it is advertised to do, nothing more, nothing less.

It comes with a sheath so don't waste your money on another one. I highly recommend this knife as if I were to need it to defend myself or perform some outdoor task it would hold up well.

18590	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B0021LL1MM	Swissco Bath and Spa Pillow with Suction Cups	Great for lying down in the bath; leaks air and gets moldy after a while.	This pillow does what I expect.  It keeps my back warm when I recline on it, and keeps my head above water when I use it flat on my back.  It is just the right size to be comfortable under the neck with no straining.  I will say that it is just a tad narrow. It definitely does not span from shoulder to shoulder.  So to protect your back from a freezing cold tub back, you will need to position it very strategically.  Overall, though,  this was a good purchase.  Update 1+ years later: The pillow has developed a few drawbacks over time.    First, it started leaking, which means it constantly fizzles and sputters air out when you're leaning on it.  This can range from insignificant annoyance to major detractor from how relaxing your bath is.  Second, the pillow's exterior is very susceptible to growing bath mold.  If you let this get bad, you will not want to use it in your bath again.  I literally have had pieces of mold flaking off and floating in the tub with me while using this pillow.  I've tried soaking it in a vinegar solution, and I've tried spraying it with anti mildew spray and scrubbing it with a plastic bristle brush.  Nothing seems to keep it clean anymore.  I didn't buy this pillow intending it to have a useful life of only about a year.  But that's about what I got.  After that, you'd better have been cleaning it routinely, because otherwise, it gets *funky*.  Your mileage may vary.

3378	__label1__	1	N	Grocery	B00BG0ZJ0Y	MatchaDNA Organic Powdered Matcha Green Tea, 10 Ounce	BEWARE of LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE MATCHA!!!	BEWARE of LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE MATCHA!!! Last year ConsumerLab.com (a leading provider of consumer information and independent evaluations of products that affect health and nutrition) said that it is NOT ADVISABLE TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha!!! The only way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. I would like to see the actual laboratory report on lead content of matchaDNA Chinese Matcha. It should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the matchaDNA so that we can all see the results. Once I see the laboratory report on Amazon, I will decide whether or not to drink this Chinese matcha.<br /><br />I believe that lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China. Subsequently, contaminated water gets into the agricultural soil via water irrigation systems which obtain water from the River Yangtze. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a real risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!<br /><br />I was happy to read that this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was &#34;below the measurable limit&#34; :)<br /><br />The reason why we should all check the amount of lead in Chinese matcha before drinking it is that Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the BRAIN (causing learning and behavioural problems), heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), and the bones! It is important that we see the lab report. It is a food safety issue!!
14672	__label2__	4	Y	Books	1592407498	Duke: A Life of Duke Ellington	Duke Matches or Tops Teachout's Book on Satchmo	Terry Teachout has followed his book on Louis Armstrong with an equal or better one on Duke Ellington. More than a biography he creates a critical overview of the work with an analysis of its strength and weakness. For Ellington the orchestra was his instrument and this book is as complex as its many members and relationships. None more so that his exploited, brilliant altar ego the composer and arranger Billy Strayhorn. Teachout reveals that typically Ellington failed to credit his collaborators and kept the royalties for his music to fund the expense of keeping the well paid band on the road. This portrait of a genius of jazz is less than flattering but unflinching in its depth, insight and honesty. It is overall the best book possible on a complex subject.

11844	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B000B5XOWA	Airplane! (Don't Call Me Shirley! Edition)	I am serious. And don't call me Shirley	"Airplane! is not just A comedy movie, but one of THE comedy movies -- movies like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Young Frankenstein.""<br /><br />And honestly, it deserves to be in that august company. This is one of the funniest movies ever, with a constant barrage of gags, running jokes, spoofs and parodies of various movies (""Saturday Night Fever,"" to name one) -- it never stoops to pretending to have any dramatic weight, but simply buries you in hilarity. Surely you'll enjoy this!<br /><br />Desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) , former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) follows her on an outgoing plane. It's actually his postwar trauma about planes that has led to their breakup, and now he boards the plane -- along with nuns, Hare Krishnas, an ill child, jive guys, and many others -- to prove his love for her.<br /><br />But as he tells stories of his romance to increasingly suicidal passengers, a REAL crisis arises: food poisoning! All the fish on the flight have gone bad, causing most of the passengers and the whole flight crew to become horribly ill. Only Ted has the chance to land the plane safely, with the guidance of the increasingly erratic people on the ground, and the advice of a kindly but not too helpful doctor (Leslie Nielson).<br /><br />""Airplane!"" bombards you with jokes -- crude jokes (boobs!), pop culture references (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), word puns (""... and don't call me Shirley""), parodies of other movies, characters being overly literal, random gags (Captain Oveur suffering the food poisoning symptoms) and running gags that they milk just long enough (""Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop..."").<br /><br />In other words, it's packed with so many jokes that it nearly explodes. And yet it flows naturally from one ridiculous gag to the next, like a vast patchwork quilt of hilarity where everything fits. Directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker never let the humor go slack;the one sentimental moment in the movie is handled as a parody (""Win one for the Zipper!"") and the mortal peril they're in is played for laughs.<br /><br />Example: when the flight crew gets sick, Elaine has to activate the autopilot... which is a big inflatable faux-pilot. When he later deflates, she has to blow him back up in a very suggestive way.<br /><br />And all the acting is spot-on -- everybody plays their roles with exaggerated seriousness, whether it's Hays' lethally boring tales of his life or Nielson providing ""uplifting"" encouragement at all the wrong times. Even the small roles are handled with deadly, hammy seriousness.<br /><br />Other highlights include Peter Graves as the not-so-secretly gay pilot (""Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?""), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Roger Murdock as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hagerty as the baby-voiced Elaine, and Robert Stack as the grizzled, macho yet insane Rex Kramer.<br /><br />A mere description of a plot and a few of the jokes can't sufficiently describe ""Airplane!"", one of the greatest comedy movies of all time. Insanely, uproariously funny."

15677	__label2__	4	Y	Video Games	B003RDEV8E	PS3 Move Charge Station Quad Port Charging Dock	Don't Love it, but Definitely Like it Enough for 4 stars	"So right off the bat, no, I have not tried EVERY PS Move charger there is out there as there are many, but this Nyko charger seemed the best deal for the most punch. I mean, think about it - it is one of the very FEW PS Move chargers that has 4 ports which could charge any Move controller interchangeably (as in, up to 4 motion controllers or 4 navigation controllers, or mix n' match). Another thing that attracted me was its look, kinda has this cool ""tube"" thing going on, and looks like it can solidly hold any of the controllers. It also uses light indicators to let you know when something is mid-charge, or done charging. Lastly but definitely not least, out of all the Move chargers available here on Amazon, it is the most affordable. I got a great deal by a great used dealer on here and am very happy with my transaction. No, I didn't get an original box, but don't need it.<br /><br />Anyway, so how this thing works is that you basically slide in the controller and the 2 sensors that are located on the bottom of these controllers touch the sensors at the base of these tubes, and once contact is made the charging commences. The tube itself is made of a clear plastic, and the base is black with an LED underneath (nothing crazy, a small blue thing). It has an on/off button at the front of the base, so when you are ready to charge, just hit the button, and the tubes turn red while the controller is charging. The LED light already on the controllers also blinks to let you know it is charging. Once the item is fully charged the tube goes from a red light color to a bright white (which actually looks rather cool). Once it's white, you know it's done, you pull the controller out, and you commence your playtime. The base itself plugs into the wall via AC plug that comes separate and plugs into the base. That's pretty much it. It works well enough, looks quite pretty, and even with no controllers in it does serve as a pretty cute and decorative piece.<br /><br />So onto the complaints, which aren't heavy at all but still significant enough to write about. First, the unit feels rather cheap. It's very light, and feels kinda like a flimsy plastic. I wouldn't want to drop this thing because it may very well break, the thing just feels too delicate to ever risk being dropped or mistreated in any way. Next, the thing seems to have a bit of confusion as to when something is actually done charging. By that I mean, you could have a controller inside and have it light red for about 10 minutes, then see it white. You pop it out and figure the job is done. If you put it right back inside (let's say if you just want to use the tube as a storage space, the light will turn red again and take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute for it to turn white again. It almost makes it seems like it has trouble reading (or is slow to read) when something is actually done charging. This isn't a big deal except that it MAY cause confusion as to knowing which controller is charge and which isn't. I myself own 2 nav controller and 2 motion controllers. As far as this thing ""over charging"" if the item is left in too long after indicating that is done charging, I am not exactly sure. When my controllers are done charging I simply take the controllers out. I didn't want to keep the controllers inside and take the risk.<br />Aside from this little quirk, there was a strange glitchy action mine did upon the first time I used it. I would put all the controllers inside, and while it was still charging (tubes were red lighted), the lights would turn off and the base blue light would come on as if the controllers were all pulled out, even though they were all in the tubes. The base blue light only turns on when there are no controllers inserted. Basically the thing was not reading my controllers even though they were in there. I turned if off and back on again and it did it again. I had remembered then that these 2 controllers that we were playing with prior on a separate game had already been fully charged, I had just simply left them in there to sit, which I stopped doing. After a second try, everything went back to normal. I just decided to ignore this as it didn't happen again. But thing DID start to work properly after a few minutes.<br />There have also been complaints that it is annoying plugging in the nav controllers, that they need to be played around with and slightly shaken or ""Jimmied"" in order for the sensor to catch notice. I DID face this issue a couple of times but honestly, the thing was so minor that I wasn't even going to put this in the review. It took 2 seconds to get the thing to sit right.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're on a budget and just want something quick and easy, this Nyko chargers not only looks cool but also works in a necessary way. While these little strange glitches sort of just happen out of a whim, it doesn't really affect the necessity for such a cute item. If you HAVE the means, and would rather pick up a Sony brand PS Move charger (the one with only 2 port holes) I would probably recommend that one over this one only because it IS the Sony official brand, and it wouldn't feel flimsy and cheap. Still, lots of Move players don't want to plug in only 2 controllers and they wait to take turns from the others; this is well enough, I would suggest checking out the official brand name. I bought these because they were very cheap and affordable, as well as look good. If you're on a budget, I would these above the others: but if you've got the dough, pick yourself up a Wii or something.<br /><br />So just to recap some pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS:<br />-More affordable than the other 4 port chargers<br />-Good looks<br />-Light LED charge indicators<br />-Functional, charging does not take long<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Cheap/delicate feeling plastic<br />-Random glitchy tendencies<br />-Very minor issues getting the nav controllers to sit right"

I have a few different backpacks I switch out every now and then, and this is one of them. I think it's a great little pack, honestly. It looks great, for one, and is made with good, sturdy materials that are able to stand up to a lot of use. The zippers are especially nice, very high quality. I can carry it or wear it, and either way it's highly functional. Lots of space inside, too. It didn't smell great when I first got it, though, like a very strong kind of fake smell, but it dissipated after a few hours being out of the shipping material. Weird, but I didn't let it deter me.

These do work but they draw a crowd before any lasting damage to the colony is done. I am hard pressed to give this much more than 4-stars because they are pretty much impossible to keep filled long enough to be totally effective. I use many indoors since sugar ants are everywhere here in the high desert during the summer… they even work with the Aphids on my trees. I know it’s not a fault of the product makers but the home brew is pretty effective and you can use it in the empty containers. It’s also more cost effective to buy the Terro 2-ounce liquid at the orange home center for a little less than 4 bucks and fill them yourself. Lastly, I can’t believe how fast these become bone dry and I can’t believe those little ants can drain one of these in a matter of days but if you keep it full long enough the trail of ants will cease and the assumption is that you have then killed off the queen and her minions… or is that just another Urban Legend?

Well, now that I'm getting a little older and time seems to be lacking, I decided to finally get a small and inexpensive snow blower, I eventually narrowed my research down to this unit. I actually ordered this in anticipation of an impending snow and ice storm. I wanted one that I could use for clearing our front and rear decks and also to clear a path to our satellite dish and to our propane tank and generator area, I also wanted to use it on our roof. So with the light weight of this little snow blower, I thought this would be perfect not to mention the price is great!<br /><br />I was able to assemble it with very little time and effort and was able to try it out the next morning. With it being Mid December, we have about 5-6 inches of soft but coarse snow and another 2-3 inches of hard packed snow on top of that and there's also about two inches of ice on top of that. So as you can imagine, I put this snow blower to the test right away. I was very pleased to find that it wasn't very loud at all, I would say it's about the same as our vacuum cleaner, maybe even a little quieter. I got going on our front deck and was happy to see that the snow was being thrown well into the yard and away from the deck, I would say about 20-25 feet! I will say that due to the light weight of the unit, it did take a little muscle to push the snow blower into the hard packed snow and ice in some spots. I quickly learned that if you let the blade chew or ease it's way into the snow, you can make some pretty good progress. The motor was more than adequate for the snow, packed snow and ice combination that I was clearing from my deck. After reading some reviews that said that they had problems with the snow chute, to my surprise, the chute was fairly easy to adjust and the snow blower made quick work of a task that would usuallytake about a half hour. It probably cleared the deck in about half the time it would take with a shovel, but the best part was that it only took about 1/4 of the effort! Soon, I was clearing a spot where our garbage cans sit and then I was off to make a path to our satellite, which seems to get clogged up with snow ALL of the time. Next, I was clearing a path to our propane tank and then to the shelter that holds our portable generator. I was pleased that this usually tiresome and daunting task was already done, all with minimal effort.<br /><br />One thing I did learn almost immediately is that you better make sure everything is cleared from your path. This snow blower will chew up and spit up anything in it's path!! My son is minus a few less toy plastic trucks that I didn't see under the snow and all of them were chewed up and shot about 20 feet away!! I have yet to finish clearing the back deck and will then be moving on up to the roof to clear it off also. I hope this review helps someone, because at this point I can say so far, so good!

8514	__label1__	4	N	Baby	B009SPS3V6	iBaby Monitor M3s Wireless Digital Baby Monitor with 360 Rotation, Night Vision and Two-way Speakers for iPhone and Android	Amazing Baby monitor	"There are a lot of baby monitors on the market, but if you are searching for a baby monitor that will connect you with your baby regardless of your location, I'd highly recommend the iBaby M3s. I love how easy it is that I can set up the baby monitor. I didn't have to mess around with wi-fi or Bluetooth settings to get the monitor connected to my iPhone. Just paired my phone and the moitor with USB cable, and that's it. One of the best things I like about the unit is that I don't have to leave the app view on all the time at night, it will send me an alert when my baby is awake. It is a really useful feature. And the cherry on top, is that whenever the alert is sent to me, I also get a few pictures of my baby, so I know if my baby is really awake or it is just a false alarm.<br />However, just like any other baby monitors out there, this one is not without flaw. There is no iPad version of the iBaby View app. You have to manually switch to ""iPhone Only"" if you are using an ipad. And since the app is designed for iPhone, the image is stretched out on iPad's larger screen, so it's not as clear.<br />But overall, I believe that this is an amazing product, I would recommend it to all the parents of young babies."

This is an incredible quality boot for the price. I've spent over 100$ for boots that do not have the quality and comfort as these boots do for under 60$. As far as sizing, I can say for myself that I ordered my typical size 9 wide and they fit perfect. No slipping on the back heel with a comfortable amount of room on the toes. The side-zip feature is also awesome! You can have the boots tied and tucked away and can quickly unzip the side-zip to quickly get them on and off. I will write a follow up review for the boots in a few months to see how they hold up but as of now, you can't beat the price for the quality and comfort of these boots. Why spend 100-200$ when you can spend less than 60$ for the same quality and comfort?

My father's barber is also familiar with them, and uses them frequently with patients at a care facility.  They are easy to use.  There's minimal dribbling of moisure as you wash your patient's hair; the net allows you to massage the scalp, and the excellent containment keeps the soap from flowing into your patient's eyes, as you'd encounter in a normal wash.  They're comfortable for the patient and easy to use.  I highly recommend them  - not just for those in a patient-care environment, either:  parents who've tussled the soapy heads of squirming kids will find these two-minute head washers a parent's dream.

10466	__label1__	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00S5MBB1C	Upstar P32ES8 32-Inch 720p LED TV (2015 Model)	Great TV after a lot of tweaking	If you're anything like me you see that this TV is labeled as LED; then you look at the picture and see a lot of fat for the usual Samsung LED depth. Make no mistake this is an LED TV. I got this for my bedroom to replace my 23 inch Samsung Syncmaster. It is great for the price and I'd recommend it. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00C18YRSA  I use this TV mostly for 1080 mp4 movies and blurays (I download what I want to watch instead of waiting for it on cable), and my Xbox and PS3.  Long story short, Comcast had me thinking I purchased my first dud from Samsung. Seriously, the colors look washed out and none of the channels really had that crisp clear picture I was hoping for. If you plan to use this solely for Comcast, I can't really recommend it. In fact, I've always found blu ray quality to be so much better than cable that I've stopped using cable for anything but football and cartoons. Movies MUST be in my PS3's blu ray player or my own 1080p files.  I learned 2 things about the TV right off the bat. If you have Comcast, you cannot fully customize the TV's picture. An essential feature called HDMI black levels actually looks much better when its set to low. I have 2 different Comcast HD boxes and since neither of them broadcast at 1080, this feature is locked out.  I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  The second thing I learned about is what the depth is for. Samsung didn't advertise this (or maybe its just my TV), but I have absolutely NO BACKLIGHT BLEED. When Black Ops goes to the loading screen on my Xbox, it gets so dark that I think the TV is off! The only indication that it is on is the Black Ops logo in the corner spinning. There isn't even the SLIGHTEST inkling of white anywhere! I'm not exaggerating. The obvious second reason why this TV is fat for an LED is that Samsung made an effort to improve the sound. When I turn on the HD surround coupled with the movie option, there is much more bass than I thought it would be. THe explosions in my games and the soundtracks in movies sound vastly better than I thought they would. Granted, I am not the type to go out and spend 600 on some Bose speakers, but the sound is NOT a con for me this time around.  NOW ON TO THE PICTURE  As I said, I was not exactly thrilled with the picture RIGHT off the bat. It looked like my old 23 inch Syncmaster, just a lot bigger. Let me tell you, this is not one of those TV's that look great right out of the box. You have to toy around with the settings a bit to get the optimal picture. I wanted sharpness coupled with colors that pop like crazy.....and I got it. Dynamic is the brightest setting, but I coupled this with the HDMI black levels set to low (option not available for Comcast cable box) and voila, moving photographs! I'm not a pro but this is my setup:  Mode: Dynamic Backlight: 18 Contrast: 85 Brightness: 50 Sharpness: 80 Color: 70 TInt: G/R 50/50 Standard color tone with screen fit in the additional options, with HDMI black level set to low.  My games and blurays look AMAZING. The picture is easily better than my mom's 46 inch Samsung up front. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0071NWYP8  REMEMBER that some of the good options are cut off from Comcast and the use of component cables. In games, I do have to up the brightness or gamma a little, but it ends up looking BRILLIANT. I am going through my entire library of games and they feel like entirely new experiences! There is a 32 inch 720p option as well, but I just was not comfortable with 720p max. The new game consoles are gojng to have native 1080 so that's what I wanted. BTW did I mention I'm a big gamer?  THE CONS  WITH A COMCAST CABLE BOX I could see no difference between HDMI and component. I kept switching back and fourth, but since the max output is 1080i, there were no differences in picture.  Well I saw this TV up on Amazon before it was on Samsung's website. Yeah, WOW. Sometimes I wanted to see the TVs specs from Samsung directly before I made my buy. Make no mistake this is NOT a 120 HZ tv although it is labeled as one. I have no idea what clearmotion 120 is, but it makes my TV much darker. The feature is entirely useless and does nothing to the picture or add the &#34;soap opera&#34; effect like I had hoped (it looks great for games).  VERDICT  With a lot of tweaking, I got the picture to look beautiful. I will use my Comcast box sparingly, but I might move to FIOS if the support full 1080. Watching movies on my PS3 and playing games on my Xbox stopped me from returning the TV. I will not be surprised if this set gets bad reviews from Comcast users (even though Its not Samsung's fault). I'm a &#34;videophile&#34; and this passed my personal test with vibrant colors.  In the end get yourself one of these http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S5MBB1C

11264	__label2__	5	N	Video Games	B00K2O5360	The Wolf Among Us - PlayStation 4	A Comic Book in Video Game's Clothing	"Disclosure: Played as a PSN download<br /><br />It seems TellTale has found, and mastered, a niche: Take a comic book (okay, okay...'graphic novel'), and make it interactive by turning it into a video game. While that rarely seems to work when a company tries to do the same with a movie, TellTale has expanded on what they did perfectly with The Walking Dead and given gamers and comic book fans alike another fantastic release with The Wolf Among Us.<br /><br />The Wolf Among Us is based on Bill Willingham's Fables comic book series. And unlike The Walking Dead where the characters were mostly different but lived in a parallel time period as the characters in the source material, the characters in The Wolf Among Us are straight out of the source material. I was a huge fan of The Walking Dead comic before I played the TellTale game, but I have not read the Fables comics, so I cannot confirm whether or not the game follows the comic book storyline. My understanding is that it does not, but I'll come back and clarify that once I do indeed confirm.<br /><br />But like The Walking Dead Game, you certainly don't have to have read the comics to enjoy this game; just be sure that you are planning to get into and be part of a story-rich experience. And here's the gist: Turns out that fairy tale creatures created in writing (or film) actually `come to life', and many of them have taken residence in an area of New York City called...you guessed it... Fabletown. The sheriff, Bigby Wolf, that's right...""Big Bad Wolf,"" is protector of all the Fabletown characters, and when one of them is murdered, you take on the role of Sheriff Bigby and try to figure out whodunit.<br /><br />Along the way in just the first episode you'll meet characters from stories such as Little Red Riding Hood, the Three Little Pigs, Snow White, The Wind in the Willows, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Beauty and the Beast, Beowulf, The Wizard of Oz and a couple of other popular (and not so popular) fairy tales. But these characters are a bit...shall we say...out of character as they curse, party hearty and behave quite differently from that in which the stories that created them. The game earns its M rating.<br /><br />There are plenty of action sequences, but your time in this game is mostly spent literally being a part of the story making some tough (and some not so tough) decisions. It's the tough decisions that will affect how the rest of the game unfolds for you, and you'll have to live with the consequences of every option you choose.<br /><br />TellTale has done it again: The Wolf Among Us is excellent...especially for just a point and click. It's a gritty and graphic interactive comic book, and it's very story-rich. The graphics are appropriately very comic-bookesque. And as far as gameplay, I really do feel like I'm a character in a comic book! You might not like this game if shooters or action games are your thing. You will love this game if you read comics and graphic novels as I do. Check this game out, or I'll huff and I'll puff and...."

If Pulse can put touch pad and keyboard at the same side, it will be better.<br /><br />Now I have Netflix, YouTube, Chrome, Crackle, Pandora, NYtimes, Flixster, Snagfilm.<br />There is a App spotlight, it includes a lot of apps. Most of them are linked to website. But I enjoy it since they are free and I can enjoy them on my LG TV connected via HDMI cable.I can show my picasa pictures on my big screen with Photo App. It includes picasa and Flickr since I setup picasa account only.Chrome works great with touchpad remote but it is not easier than my computer. I have to flip remote all the time.<br /><br />I have smart tv features on my old big TV with just one hundred dollars. So happy with my decision and I love my Pulse.

11200	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B009JBZFVK	Onkyo A-9050 Integrated Stereo Amplifier (Black)	Great integrated amplifier, and huge value!  Get a good pair of speakers and you're 'all set'!	I sure do miss the glory days of hi-fi, when high quality stereo receivers, preamplifiers, amplifiers, and true speaker systems ruled the day!  Now everything is miniaturized and portable, with sound quality often suffering bigtime.  Sure MP3 files, iPODs, iPADs, and PC's (with their small speakers) are convenient ways to get (download) and carry music around with you, but you're missing out on palpable bass, a natural soundstage, and musical detail when you listen to most pairs of compromised headphones or PC speakers, sadly typical of most music listening done today.  Do yourselves a big favor-  if you truly love music and you wish to listen to music in all it's grandness and glory, get a good integrated amplifier (or separates- preamp and amp combo), and a great set of speakers to hook up your digital files player or PC to.  Your ears will thank you!  Contrary to belief, you really don't have to spend a fortune if you know what to look for.  Knowledge is power, and equates to savings too.  The great thing about this integrated amp is that it already has an excellent built-in Wolfson DAC, and Onkyo is a respected name in audio going back decades.  I just helped my neighbor (college student) select his very first stereo system with conventional speakers, and I suggested this integrated amp.  He also wanted a pair of good bookshelf speakers, and he ended up with JBL ES30's.  His budget was $700, which was met (including RCA to mini-plug stereo cable and a short run of thick speaker wire).  We were both floored when we listened to some of his higher-res digital files through the Onkyo and JBL's!  He said, and I quote:  &#34;I can now hear nuances i've never heard before, and I can now feel my music!  I never knew my iPOD could sound so great!&#34;  'Nuff said!
13407	__label2__	5	N	Health & Personal Care	B0015QSW4O	Cytosport - Muscle Milk Lean Muscle Protein Powder, Cookies N' Creme - 4.94 lbs	Best taste, hands down	I am reviewing the Vanilla Creme flavor, for those of you keeping track, but I also feel the same way about the taste of the Muscle Milk Chocolate flavor.<br /><br />As a vegetarian for 27 years, I am in the habit of making a breakfast smoothie every morning with various fruits, ground flaxseed, low fat yogurt and a few other healthful things, including a scoop of protein powder. I've tried several different brands and while I can't say I notice a great deal of difference in the performance of the powders--how they mix into the smoothie, how I feel after using them for a while, etc.--there IS an obvious difference in the taste. For example, while I hate to blast my beloved Trader Joe's, the taste of their brand of vanilla protein powder is astonishingly poor. If you take a taste of the Muscle Milk brand and then immediately try a bit of the Trader Joe's, it is not much of an exaggeration to say that the latter has a taste and consistency that is barely one step above sawdust (please, dear reader, note that I do not actually eat sawdust, but I am guilty of a bit of artistic license in my reviews). Other brands, while not quite THAT bad, are still way behind Muscle Milk in the taste category. This is the only brand I have found which really tastes good--like something you'd want to drink in a shake even if you DIDN'T need protein powder.<br /><br />So having tried 6 or 7 brands now, I can easily say that this is not only the best tasting, but the best tasting BY FAR. Highly recommended.

8616	__label1__	5	N	Baby	B00HUARZSS	Medela Disposable Nursing Bra Pads, 120 Count	A MUST HAVE for moms!!!	I initially sought these out due to the recommendation of my friend who is in the La Leche leage, and I have never been happier that I bought them! Best used with the (as seen in the picture)   http://fave.co/1bKRVJA  The fastener included on the pad is enough to keep you safe from any possible worry of movement. You just need to make sure that you place the fastener on the top side of your bra instead of on the bottom (I tried both). You can't even feel them on after the first day of adjusting... but the only thing I will say as a con is that you should be weary of what bra you use with them. I am using an all cloth, no shape/padding/wire nursing bra and 5 - 10% of the time you can see the bunched sides of the circular pad under the shirt. I think if I had a bra with more shaping to it, the pads would never show through.  I purchased 120 packs and still have yet to use half - and I'm in the third week post C-section delivery. I recommend these to anyone I know who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or looking for an answer for milk leaks. I have yet to experience a leak, or embarrassment, and I wear these every day and night. Also worth mentioning - they do stay in place. I haven't worried about these moving around at all.  Definitely a must have for new moms or an excellent gift item for anyone's shower if they breast feed or not. :)  I TOTALLY recommend getting   http://fave.co/1bKRZJ3

11577	__label2__	5	Y	Luggage	B00H7VT2CM	WanEway Portable Digital Luggage Scale Gadget Weighing Suitcase 110lbs Pounds with Temperature Sensor and Tare Function	NICE FUNCTIONAL LUGGAGE SCALE AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE	The scale came in with battery installed and ready to go. I mention this because some reviews for other scales said that the battery went dead within a month after being used and put away. This scale had to be in transit for over 3 weeks and was probably on a shelf before that, so the battery doesn't appear to drain during storage. I tried it out and it said a bag was 26+ lbs. I weighed that same bag on a doctors office type balance beam scale and it measured 29+ lbs. Close enough. I figure that any weight this scale measures, I can add about 5 lbs to be safe. I was only going to give this 4 stars due to the slight inaccuracy, but decided that for this type of item, it is very well within expectations and the slight inaccuracy was just being too picky, so I went with the 5 stars. Just an FYI - it uses a CR2032 coin battery.

10821	__label2__	5	Y	Electronics	B009OBCAW2	HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System	Great device for Bluetooth audio!	Given the high rating of this device on Amazon, I decided to give it a try so I could add Bluetooth capabilities to a mini-system that I keep in the kitchen.  Since buying it, I've been transporting it between other systems in the house.<br /><br />Audio quality seems to be pretty good--not as good as a direct connection, but this is all about convenience.  What really shines is its ability to easily pair with other devices.  I find this receiver with no problems using the Bluetooth built into my laptop.  But with my phone, all I need to do is tap the top of this device with my phone; the phone then enables its own Bluetooth connection, and pairs automatically.  (The magic of NFC, aka near-field communications.)<br /><br />With such easy pairing, and good sound quality, I can't rate this any less than five stars.  It has worked flawlessly for me in the time that I've owned it, and plan on buying at least two more of these in the near future.

10622	__label2__	4	N	Home Improvement	B00JJY0S4G	Lutron P-PKG1W-WH  Caseta Wireless 600-watt/150-watt Multi-Location In-Wall Dimmer with Pico Remote Control Kit, White	Finally a remote capable switch that fit into my standard switch box in my wall...	I almost gave this a 5 star review, but as much as I WANTED to, I just couldn't quite for one reason - the buttons.<br /><br />To give a bit of background, I have a great room that has only four recessed cans in the ceiling to light the whole room.  To along the peak of the ceiling, and two down one slope over the fireplace.  The controls for the two main ones are in a bank with the switches for the hallway and the kitchen, right in my traffic pattern.  The controls for the two on the other edge of the room are next to the fireplace, the exact opposite side of the room.  So those don't get used too often, despite how useful they can be sometimes.<br /><br />So lighting has been a real pain in here, especially as I bounced from one type of light to another trying to find something that worked well.  The main ones that are always on after sundown are LED's now, nice 6k units that brighten up the area I'm in just fine.  But often when my son and I are building Lego or Megablok sets, we need the other lights after sunset since the two main just don't provide enough light.  That's about the only time I usually turn on the others.<br /><br />I thought if I had a remote for them, I'd be more likely to use them when needed for other things.<br /><br />This is my third or fourth try to get some kind of wireless control for this location.  The others were just too bulky to fit within the &#34;standard&#34; box the builders used here for the wall switch.  This is the first that fit, and it didn't even have to be crammed in there.  It came with the three wire connectors to hook it up to the wires from the walls, and they were large enough to cover the stripped part of the copper on the existing wires, but not so large as to be too bulky to shove behind the box of the dimmer.<br /><br />The wall plate is two pices, the one piece with screws that screws to the actual switch hardware, then a plate that snaps into place over that, so this plate DOES stick out from the wall more than a standard wall plate does, noticeably more.  Installation took me all of 6 minutes from start to finish, including two trips to the basement to turn the circuit off and back on.<br /><br />The remote comes unsynchronized, so you have to sync it with the switch. Easy enough, hold OFF on the wall switch for 10 seconds or so, then do the same on the OFF switch on the remote.<br /><br />It works well.  I like the dimming up it does for the bulbs when turned on, and that it dims off as well, rather than just instant brightness or darkness.  The &#34;favorite&#34; raised button on the remote is handy if you have a preferred setting you want to use most of the time,  The remote is responsive and accurate - I've not had any misfires.<br /><br />Now the reason I took a star off - the buttons.  I really hate the feel of them.  There's a button centered in the undersized buttons, and they roll all around it, in all directions.  So it always feels like it's about to come loose or something.  They tilt all around that center pivot point if you hit one of the edges.  The other downside is that there is no &#34;favorite&#34; or &#34;last&#34; setting for the wall switch itself.  I had installed the MACL-153M-WH switch for my mom at her condo, and that's just the single button, feels better, and remembers a favorite setting from just the wall switch.  This one doesn't have the same functionality unfortunately.<br /><br />My other wishlist item would've been that it have an LED somewhere for easy finding in the dark.  But the LED's are only on if the light is on.  The whole &#34;raised icon&#34; to &#34;easily find in the dark&#34; really seems pretty useless to me - if you've already got your hands on the switch and can feel the raised icon, clearly you've ALREADY found the switch...<br /><br />Apparently the CFL's I had in the cans were not dimmable, since as soon as I turned this on, they just started blinking on and off.  This wouldn't even work with them as a simple on/off switch.  But that was good, it gave me the excuse to buy some better LED's, as these were the only cans left that I hadn't swapped to LED yet.<br /><br />But as I said, this is the first switch I've tried at home that fit my switch box in the wall.  It works very well, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the buttons.

10240	__label1__	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00NVRRFN4	VIZIO E400I-B2 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED TV (Refurbished)	Great TV	Yes this is refurbished. Yes it works just like the standard brand. But with this one you save $100 over the non-refurbished price tag http://fave.co/1bLffXC  The VIZIO E400I-B2 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED kicks the pants of many LCDs that cost a lot more. Employing minimal zones and actual LEDs (to bring down costs) and much-improved dimming logic, the E series achieves truly remarkable black-level performance. The rest of its picture is also plenty good, and its price is simply phenomenal.  And comparing it to other TV's on the market, Vizio's E series doesn't hold a candle to the picture quality of a great plasma like this one http://fave.co/1c3T3sw  But again, look at that price tag...  Here are the 2 adjustments I'd recommend: --Go to Picture&#62;Advanced Picture then set the BLACK DETAIL to HIGH to get those rich blacks. The default is OFF which I don't understand -- why have a great feature like this then bury it in the settings and turn it off? --Right below Black Detail is BACKLIGHT CONTROL. The default is ON -- turn it OFF. I think it's a mode that saves a tiny bit of power but looks awful with the backlight always fluctuating. It might save 3¢ per month so yeah turn it off.  I like to keep things simple so I found these picture settings to be just dandy: Backlight - 35 Brightness - 35 Contrast - 95 Color - 50 Tint - 0 Sharpness - 50 (Advanced Picture) Color Temperature - Normal Black Detail - High Backlight Control - Off Reduce Signal Noise - Low Reduce Black Noise - Low Film Mode - Auto  OR these settings: Backlight - 50 Brightness - 50 Contrast - 50 Color - 50 Tint - 0 Sharpness - 50 (Advanced Picture) Color Temperature - Normal Black Detail - High Backlight Control - Off Reduce Signal Noise - Low Reduce Black Noise - Low Film Mode - Autoce Black Noise - Low<br />Film Mode - Auto

Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a ""fat burner"" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)"

This whistle is great and has worked wonders with our dog. He comes to the sound of the whistle no matter what, it's been the most effective way to teach him to come. It was also very successful in teaching him not to bark continuously.  Something about the sound of this whistle really catches his attention.  I am doing the training every day and hopeful that it will yield positive results in some weeks to come and my dog will obey whatever commands I make to him.  Recommended for anyone trying to train their dog.
17518	__label2__	4	Y	Pet Products	B000LPOUNW	Go Cat Cat Catcher Teaser Wand with Mouse Cat Toy	Kitty loves this toy!	This is my cat's absolute favorite toy. The first time she saw it she totally flipped out and went after it. She will chase it until she is so tired she nearly passes out! Unfortunately, my kids left it out and she totally destroyed the mouse part. Next time I will order several. I would give it 5 stars if it were more durable.
11978	__label2__	5	Y	PC	B00IDWFN4U	Corsair Raptor M45-5000 DPI Optical Sensor Gaming Mouse (Raptor M45)	Great mouse with a couple caveats.	What a beautiful mouse. Has everything you will ever need for the average user. This isn't an MMO mouse or anything so don't expect myriad buttons and access to those kinds of features. It does have an extensive macro system though, and the features on the new firmware are pretty decent for this price range. At any rate mouse enthusiasts usually know what their mouses are for.  The side pads as many have said have a sweet feeling sandpaper-like compound... BUT this doesn't last as long as one would like for the thumb position IF you use the mouse a lot. MANY mice today use that decrepit shiny and sticky plastic for where your thumb/pinky finger goes...  The feeling after this compound wears down is akin to a slightly stickier plastic. The plastic itself is hard enough so the feeling is never too annoying; I must stress how important this is, because a soft and sticky plastic for my thumb and other fingers will have me wanting to throw the mouse away nearly immediately. I wish the normal sandpaper feel had been able to keep itself for at least 6 months. But this is still much better than my last mouse in feel and touch. I love the overall design of it.  I'm just grateful they didn't go with that nasty, shiny stuff CM used on my Havoc.   Anyway, I updated firmware and installed software in 2 minutes. While not quite the extensive system of options that CM has, this mouse for the time being has topped my old Havoc which had the aforementioned sticky plastic problem requiring tape. Otherwise I think CM's software is better and allows a lot more functionality with LEDs and a couple other things. What is there is pretty decent and you can tune each axis on the pad and have three different slots for DPI, easily reachable below the scroll wheel. A single, small and red LED light is for the first slot and this goes to three lights. They are pretty low key and not too bright. I shut off the Corsair logo as it was too bright and annoying for my tastes.  I am not sure what thenative specs are on the DPI sensor but I use about 900-1200 on my desktop and it feels about perfect. I certainly don't need much higher. My PC gaming is mostly done with a controller, but scrolling and clicking buttons works great for the games that need it.   As with every mouse make sure it fits your hand. I feel I can put my palm into if I want or just basically finger touch it and the control and ease with how this mouse glides makes mousing fun again (I have been using some dimestore version for the past 10 days). They have a nice supplement of weights if you choose to lower what they have at the factory. I don't mind it right out of the box. Others will want to take a weight or two out.  The roller is also topnotch here and has a metal and rubber design. Still working great after a year of solid work. The materials have held fairly well over this time and I am completely satisfied with the mouse. All in all a homerun for the M45.

19804	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B001GDSO4Y	Aska: Japanese Drum	Great Drumming; Thread Bare Production	Performances = 3-1/2 stars; DVD production values = barely 2 stars.  Overall, very fine drumming especially for the first and last sets.  Impact is significantly reduced by minimally creative camera work and unimaginative video editing.  Highly repetitive shots (which exclude some performer close-ups) seems to indicate that an inadequate number of cameras were used and only a single recording of each set was made.  Audio is an insult to the performers!  Stereo only.  Poor placement of microphones and/or inadequate audio editing results in a loss of stage sound from front to rear--only instruments up front (or close to the front) can be heard the best or at all.

6388	__label1__	5	N	Lawn and Garden	B00O1WU3W8	EcoTraction ET3RJ All-Natural Volcanic Mineral Ice Traction Granules, 7.7-Pound Jug	This is my favorite copy & printing paper	This is my favorite copy & printing paper.<br /><br />I've found that it works well with this:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BB5DJU6/<br /><br /> Georgia-Pacific was recommended to me years ago by a copier franchise owner. He told me it would not produce a lot of messy dust in the copier/printer as other papers do. I have been using it ever since. I have always liked the 5-ream pack-see GP Copy & Print Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 20 Lb, 5 Reams/Carton (2500 Sheets). It's convenient, but was not available this time with &#34;&#34;Amazon Prime&#34;&#34; shipping. In fact, the price was much higher (not being sold by Amazon). So, I saw these 3-ream cartons with &#34;&#34;Prime.&#34;&#34; Like the 5-ream, these are easy to carry, compared to the bigger boxes of ten reams. I have always found the price to be one of the best bargains. It looks like Amazon is going to keep it like that. One of my main complaints about having paper like this delivered is that they so often come &#34;&#34;beat-up!&#34;&#34; Then, you have to go through the whole process of returning it. What a pain! I think we all hate that! Right? What's the use? Not this time! These came from the manufacturer in a thicker than normal cardboard box which seemed to resist shipping damage. Hopefully, this is where I will buy all my paper in the future.<br /><br />Update: 4/5/2014 -- Almost a year later, this is where I have bought most of my paper since. I am extremely satisfied with this paper, the size of the box, the convenience, the packing (if you buy more than one box), basically everything! And, in all this time I have not had a &#34;&#34;beat-up&#34;&#34; box of paper delivered.<br /><br />Update: 8/27/2014 -- I have tried other deals on the 10-Ream Cartons GP Spectrum Premium Multi Use Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 10 Reams/Carton (5000 Sheets) that occasionally appear, but each time the office staff has asked that we go back to using this economical, very convenient and easy to handle 3-Ream Pack.<br /><br />Update: 2/18/2015 -- I tried GP Spectrum® 96 Multipurpose Paper at a good price. Still, I keep coming back to this best of all bargains in copy paper.

My niece is so excited about this bed. It is her first big girl bed, and she constantly tells us how much she loves it and how comfy it is. She sleeps good too. The adults have laid on it and a couple took naps, as they too thought it quite comfy. I would highly recommend this mattress!

Bought it for a friend's son's first year birthday present because it doesn't need batteries and is gender neutral. She loved it because there are no batteries, no sounds, and no lights. Her son loves making sandwiches for their dog. Would definitely recommend
11799	__label2__	4	Y	Pet Products	B000URLVXI	Ideal Pet Products 7-by-11-Inch Aluminum Medium Deluxe Pet Door with Telescoping Frame	Far better than the PetSafe plastic pet door.	I ordered and returned a PetSafe plastic pet door that I had ordered from Amazon. That door received a much longer and detailed review than the review on this one will be.<br /><br />This door is much better quality and well worth the extra cost over what the plastic door cost. I deducted one star simply because the total cost, for either door, is around 25% to 30% more than what they are worth and cost to manufacture. But in today's world, isn't everything?

It has a good shape & you will never feel that it will slip off your hands, the additional cover protects the usb from dust & damages too.
611	__label1__	1	N	Home	B00NAX7H78	Silhouette Cameo -- Starter Bundle	there's no repair center and machine goes off every 20 minutes...	Don't bother buying this cutting machine, because you'll end up with wasting a good money on something that cannot be repaired. Once I got the package, I wanted to install the machine via internet updates, and after I connected (hardly) online I download the latest software, but the problem was not in that. The problem was that, in every 20 minutes, machine goes off for no apparent reason. The worst thing is that the Silhouette repair center DOESN'T EXIST. so no one could repair this machine. I ended up as returning this item to Amazon...<br /><br />Once I got a refund, I bought Cricut Explore ( http://amzn.to/13Njs94 ) cutting machine which was far more better than Silhoutte version. I didn't had any problems in installing it and the fact that it comes with battery that last for 2-3 hours is really something that beats Silhouette version :).

The cups are of a really good quality and are in a very close to real shade of a green small sized cactus, which is not growing in the Sahara desert but is placed eloquently in the kitchen. However, you will have to keep an eye on the little ones, who may mistake it for a real cactus and get all excited.

I've tried the Iris system (fail), i've looked at others, but this is a nice system with lots of growth potential.  I am already using it with door sensors, door locks, and getting ready to set up a garage door opener with the system.  There are no stupid monthly fees to use all the features, like some other products. It works with Zigbee and Z-wave devices.  Setup is easy, and the &#34;scripting&#34; process is fairly straightforward.  Some of the more advanced features take a little time to figure out, but stick with it and it will make sense.

Make something you can take off of the pillow.
14046	__label2__	3	N	Musical Instruments	B00K02D58M	Warwick LWA1000BLACK Bass Amplifier Head	Try others first	This amp is OK but not what it is advertised to be. Contrary to what the videos say, it is not the only Class D amp on the market to provide the wattage advertised. It has that harsh solid state sound that some of the other companies overcome by using hybrid (Tube/Solid State technology). It does have some nice features. The dual channels are very niece. The EQ is very nice because they kept it simple. I also like the compression. It seems like most Bass Amp makers have gotten away from adding compression in the last 10 years. All in All it isn’t a bad amp/sound but Warwick really over hyped it. The advertisement makes it sound like it has the best sound out there in the Class D market and it simply is not true. You can find better by doing your research and trying one out. I bought one because of the advertisement and was pretty excited about the dual channels. (I like to play 2 guitars during a performance) but was very disappointed by its, sound. I guess I can always use a $799.00 practice amp.

I put a different pad on it though because the one that comes with it is a bit like a sponge and I didn't want to come to the tree and sit on a wet sponge. I didn't actually test its porosity but it sure looks like a sponge and I didn't want to find out the hard way.

9573	__label1__	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00SMBGGV6	VIZIO SB3851-C0 38-Inch 5.1 Channel Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer and Satellite Speakers (2015 Model)	VIZIO SB3851-C0 38-Inch 5.1 Channel Sound Bar	Whether evaluating presentation, performance, ease of operation, versatility, this  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SMBGGV6  is without a doubt one of the best you can get these days at this price level. It's a large sound bar plus subwoofer and satellite speakers set that support just about any type of 'wired' connection including HDMI  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00NH126Q0  out with ARC and can also pair and play off Bluetooth supporting devices such as phones or tablets.<br /><br />Just to get it out of the way, I am going to start with the negatives, few as they are and will follow with a detailed description of what you are getting. So, here are the negatives:<br /><br />- Partially wired. The satellite speakers are in fact wired to the subwoofer, probably a small price to pay for true surround.<br />- 5.1 surround, not 7.1 or 7.2. Yes, it's a sound bar, not a full surround speakers set.<br />- Can't play off USB thumb drives or SD cards directly. You will need some Bluetooth device for that.<br /><br />And that's it, all the negatives I can think of so let me discuss the system overall.<br /><br />PRESENTATION AND PACKAGING<br /><br />As I noted above, this is a massive set and Vizio did an excellent job to get everything in a neatly organized box with all components clearly labeled and easy to locate. This is what's in the box:<br /><br />∙ the 54&#34; bar<br />∙ subwoofer<br />∙ 2 satellite speakers<br />∙ remote control and batteries<br />∙ cables: optical, stereo RCA 3.5 mm, coax, HDMI, 2 satellite speaker, 2 power cables  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00NH126Q0<br />∙ mounting hardware: 2 sound bar wall mount brackets, 2 sound bar wall mount lugs, 2 satellite speaker wall mount brackets, 2 satellite speaker wall mount lugs<br />∙ wall mount template<br />∙ 4 Velcro cable ties<br />∙ Quick Start Guide<br /><br />All of the above are quality items and I experienced near zero frustration getting them out of the box. Even better, just in case you may wish to return your purchase, there is a nice diagram on the box that shows exactly where everything is so, for as long as you don't destroy the Styrofoam it should be easy to get everything back in.<br /><br />SETUP<br /><br />Getting everything to work was quick and easy.<br /><br />The Manual is very well written and it covers and illustrates the speakers layout, mounting and how everything is connected. It explains clearly how to use the HDMI's ARC feature with your TV (make sure that the TV supports it if you are going to buy a new one) and how to wire several devices to the bar, taking advantage of its many ports.<br /><br />By the way, you get: RCA Analog Audio In, Optical, 3.5mm Analog Audio In, Digital Coax Audio In, HDMI Out (ARC), HDMI In and USB. And, of course you can pair wirelessly via Bluetooth. The bar supports aptX, allowing real-time streaming of high quality stereo audio over Bluetooth.<br /><br />OPERATION<br /><br />The set comes with a great, simple and effective remote control. It really comes down to selecting the proper input and then let it roar, so to speak. The manual explains how you can integrate the system into another 'universal' remote. I haven't tried that yet but it appears to be very much the standard remote 'learning' process.<br /><br />The subwoofer has a wireless link to the main bar which was properly set in my case but, just in case, there is a pair button also. All wires are properly labelled and, as I noted already, the manual explains how you can have several devices connected. All was quickly done for my experimental setup involving a TV and a gaming console.<br /><br />When paired with a Bluetooth device, your phone or tablet or laptop have complete control over what is playing on the bar.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br /><br />Getting to the final question of 'how does it sound', the brief answer is 'it sounds grrreat'. Thanks to the satellite speakers, this is true 5.1 surround, not a simulationand it's done through some good quality hardware.<br /><br />Talking specs, this is what you get:<br /><br />∙ Sound pressure Level (system): 104 dB<br />∙ Frequency response (system): 45 Hz - 20 KHz<br />∙ 2 3&#34; full range transducers (bar, one left and one right)<br />∙ 2 3x6&#34; bass radiators<br />∙ 3&#34; full range transducer (bar, center)<br />∙ 2 3&#34; full range transducers (one per each satellite)<br /><br />SUPPORT AND WARRANTY<br /><br />Vizio promises lifetime support for the product to cover setup, connecting and technical problems. They also have a one-year limited warranty.<br /><br />RATING<br /><br />I have no choice but award Vizio's bar 5 stars because I love it. It's as close to ideal for anyone looking for a 'serious' bar to work with a large TV that delivers great surround and plays off mobile devices. Get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SMBGGV6

She has always been into healthy foods and healthy living. Niacin has always been on the list. It's really good for circulation. Just a caution that even though some say 'flush-free', it may still cause 'flushing'. It feels like ants stinging in the areas where you need it the most. Although it can be an intense tingling, it doesn't last long. It's better if taken with food.

I can pick them up and shake them out over the litter box and tuck them back under. Very easy. I was concerned the cats would not step on them but that has not been an issue. I figured they could hop into the litter boxes from the side if they did not like them but they seem to have no issues stepping on them. Very pleased.

This is an excellent family game that always seems to change each time you play it. The game is survival, and the analytical skills needed to play the game makes this a good learning tool for the kids. I love the Settlers games and hope they make many more.

Finally forced them to close and open. Traveled on cruise and was very satisfied with luggage. Great for storing all in one case after putting clothes away. When leaving cruise, took the self departation choice of taking our own luggage off which enabled us to get on our way an hour earlier. No problem rolling the luggage. Downside is no exterior pockets to just drop something into. You have to unzip the entire piece. Still a great value.

It's a bit much for the watch I purchased it for, some I'm going to have to wait until I have a watch with a simpler dial and 18mm lug width to use it.
20492	__label2__	5	Y	Video Games	B002XUMAMQ	Phantasy Star Portable 2 [Japan Import]	Great but not the one I wanted	The game I'm sure is great if you understand what you are doing. I actually did not want this one I wanted &#34;Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity&#34; and expected to play blindlessly on that game. This game is great by itself but I meant to buy the improved version however, I don't have much money to spare and at around $20 for the price I guess my excitement  made me ignore the title. Which isn't a big deal to many people but when the ability to spend $20 on something is rare for me it's urking I was also diss apointed when this game came weeks BEFORE the estimated delivery date but it was the wrong one. This game has an English release so playing a Japanese game when I could have played the english version put salt in my personal wound.<br />Well enough of my experience this game is a great one however it would make a lot more people happier if only the improved version made an international release which it never did for reasons unknown and stayed in Japan.

We sized them (no trouble at all, easy). But when it came time for each of them to put their watches on, they had an incredibly hard time managing by themselves. One son is 9, the other is 6. Once they were one (with help), the watches snapped themselves off pretty quickly. The clasp piece isn't as secure as I would like, and it came undone when they hit their wrists while playing. One even came undone as my son tried to put his arm into his coat sleeve. I love them because they are so cool, but it's not something they can use every day. I bought http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PIUH1DQ/?tag=zn0-20 because it's better.

It lets kiddo and you pick sounds to go with each page of the book.  The ants march, the grasshoppers boing, that kind of thing.  There are some lift up flaps.  It's short and not complicated, perfect for 12-24 months.  Grover is in the book too, the combo of Elmo and Grover is super cute as they try to find where the itsy bitsy spider lives and meet other insects along the way.

16113	__label2__	5	Y	Grocery	B00473QU5U	Morton Pepper Pimienta, Season-All, Seasoned Salt, 5.75-Ounce (Pack of 6)	Fantastic Seasoning!	I originally reviewed this when it was called Morton Pepper Season-All, but the name has been changed (at least on Amazon). Because of the dual language, Amazon is calling it  Morton Pimienta Season-All.  Anyway, here is my review from a couple of years ago.<br /><br />I had been using this Pepper Season-All (under the McCormick label, UPC 052100071336, 5.75 oz.) for many, many years, mostly as my secret ingredient for marinades. Not anymore.<br /><br />About 2 and a half years ago, McCormick sold its Season-All line to Morton, the Pepper Season-All having a UPC of 024600017558, for the 5.75 oz. plastic jar. As I was on my last jar, but hadn't seen the McCormick product in any stores for sometime, I contacted McCormick and they told me Season-All was now under the Morton label. I looked in every grocery I stopped at between Seattle and Spokane and could not find this product anywhere. I asked manager after manager if they were going to get any in, but they checked and said no. I had that UPC memorized, much to their surprise. Go figure.<br /><br />Then, one day at a Wal-Mart, I found it in their spice section and bought the 3 jars they had left. I believe I paid $2.38 per jar. That was the first and ONLY time I have seen it in a store ANYWHERE. When I asked a manager at the same Wal-Mart when they were getting another shipment in, he said he didn't know, as it was out of his control. I asked if I could request they special order it, but he said no. So much for that.<br /><br />It was available on the Morton website (and still is), and even though a 2-pack is reasonable at $7.58, shipping costs are ridiculous. They want $10.44 for FedEx Home delivery (6-10 business days) and $23.12 for FedEx 2nd Day delivery, which shows as arriving in 3 -7 business days. Crazy!<br /><br />Now on Amazon, there a re a few ordering options, but this one takes the cake. $16.99 for a single 5.75.oz. jar, but free Prime Shipping, which I have. Or, even worse, a 6-pack for $89.99 (Free Prime Shipping) or $79.99 ($19.99 Shipping). The latter 2 are actually cheaper overall than the one for $16.99, but you get the picture.<br /><br />What the heck are these guys smoking?<br /><br />UPDATE: Now on Amazon reasonably priced (6-pack) with Prime Shipping!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Morton-Pimienta-Season-All-Seasoned-5-75-Ounce/dp/B00473QU5U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360896118&sr=8-1&keywords=Morton+Pepper+Season-All<br /><br />In my search for alternative, I found something that works, but you also need to add course-ground black pepper. McCormick's new Perfect Pinch. It has Roasted Garlic and Red Bell Peppers, no MSG and seems to work well.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you find any Pepper Season-All in a store, buy it and try it, you won't be dissappointed!

10937	__label2__	5	N	Home	B00G00BTEA	McCulloch MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam System	Wonderful machine	This steam system is great. There are so many different tips/attachments, you can steam clean virtually any surface or object. I was extremely pleased with the results on everything I cleaned with it.<br /><br />I have used it for<br />-floors<br />-shower walls (great for removing hard water buildup up on glass shower doors!)<br />-crevices and corners around the house where dust just accumulates and there's pretty much no way to easily clean it (until I got this steamer)<br />-detailing/designs in wood trims where dust builds up - especially in the bathroom where hairspray on top of dust over and over again, has built up in the detailing of wood trim and cabinet doors and drawer fronts<br />-got all the built up grease and grime off our propane grill and it looks brand new again now inside and out<br />-vinyl siding with moss stains/buildup as well as general dirt and debris from outside<br />-patio furniture<br />-grout lines<br />-mildew stains on a bathroom ceiling<br />-wallpaper - old (decades old) dingy looking wallpaper that has yellowed over the years - used this steamer with the mop head and the wallpaper looks clean and bright again and it makes the room look so much brighter<br /><br />... the list goes on and on. Every time I cleaned something with this machine, I was on the search for something else to clean! I actually found it exciting to be able to get certain things cleaned up and looking new. The results were impressive each time I used it.<br /><br />I had previously used a steam mop on linoleum in my laundry area and I thought it did a pretty good job. The floors seemed clean, but there was some yellowish discoloration in the linoleum that always stayed there. When I used this McCulloch steamer on it, the discoloration mostly went away. The areas that still have the discoloration have faded out a bit and you can't see it as much.<br /><br />I really don't think there is anything you couldn't clean with this thing. There are so many attachmentsto be able to clean virtually anything. Even small tiny areas like buttons and crevices on your small appliances. The possibilities seem endless.<br /><br />All of the attachments can be stored in the tote bag that comes with the steamer. The extending handle makes moving the steamer around very easy. You don't have to carry it  - just roll it. It seems pretty well made and solid.<br /><br />This is a great machine to have because you can clean everything with it. It is definitely worth the investment. It might seem like a hassle to drag it out and use it, but once you do use it, you probably won't have to use it on the same item again for a while .. like the detailing in wood trim for example .. once you do it, it will be while before the buildup is bad enough again to need to use this steamer. My patio furniture I am planning to do yearly and it sure beats buying new furniture or cushions every year. We were going to get new grill plates for the grill this summer, but now we don't even have to because this did such a great job on it. Everything you see in the video up there on this page is true - this machine cleans just like it shows and does an excellent job.

Easy it is to use	These are applied the exterior glass on your car and the manufacturer claims that they can dramatically improve you wet weather driving visibility without window wipers. Well, I don't know about dramatically but they certainly do improve the visibility through windows when wet weather driving.<br /><br />I must say I was impressed with how easy it is to install. When we had a down pour recently I hardly had to use the wipers. One thing to note however, don't put this on your side windows as I did  because you will have all the water rushing in if you crack them open for any reason.<br /><br />This even works on glass shower doors and stops them from steaming up as frequently, which reduces how often I have to clean the shower.

(LVL X, Prime, Shining, EX, etc.) - All Pokemon Lots & Bundles	For the price, its alright	The cards I got from this were Metal Arceus, Suicune, Garchomp X, Hitmonchan & Syther(which at first I thought they were the first generation cards but I then realized they were from the more recent packs, so I was kinda bummed. These cards weren't in mint condition, The Arceus I got had pretty noticeable scratches which made it holographic in places where it shouldn't have been. The other cards had minor scratches. I mean, for the price, It's okay. Overall, I would probably buy this again, just because I like the surprise of the cards. But you dont get all LV X PRIME or EX cards, I only got one, two legendary, and two which were just thrown in there. But its different for everyone I suppose.

This is quite a stiff shoe compared to running shoes, but it actually is more of a hiking shoe, despite its appearance. Very comfortable. A bit wider in the toe than medium sizes of other brands, like New Balance and Puma, which I prefer, and otherwise as expected.<br /><br />Great price for a shoe I expect to wear a ton. Shipping took half the listed time. Box was a little beat up but I can deal with that.

But you know that, too.<br /><br />If anyone from the Dial Corporation reads this, please, guys, get rid of that damn curly shape.

Believe me, paying less than 290.00 (which included free shipping and for some reason no sales tax was added) The picture has been crystal clear, sound quality is good (did purchase SONY sound bar system at the same time with the money I saved) Set-up was ridiculously easy (in my bedroom) and sha-zam! Apps have worked great so far, no problem with Netflix. Vizio was suppose to introduce the M series by the first quarter of the year, here it is almost June so lost my patience and took chance on the E series, no disappointments (but damn, when are they coming out with the M series)

11663	__label2__	5	N	Kitchen	B008TNH0E4	Prepara Flexible Roasting Rack for Healthy Cooking of Meats, Poultry and Vegetables Fits all Pan Sizes	Where has this been all my life?	I do a lot of roasting and smoking. Of course I have any number of racks and trays for that purpose, depending on the meat and its size/weight. Racks don't always hold the meat where I want and they aren't easy to clean up when covered in juices, sauce, and fat that has been burned on over several hours. For a long time, I resorted to using makeshift racks made from folded and stacked aluminum foil, but this can also be sticky and messy, and it is wasteful and tedious.<br /><br />Well, thanks to the roasting laurel, no more piles of foil will be necessary. I tried this right away on my toughest recipe, involving bourbon, brown sugar, and spare ribs (right: sugar, more sugar, and fat). The laurel bends to about any shape needed and then holds that shape, sitting neatly in most any tray. I put it in a foil lined pan, plopped my ribs on top and slathered on the sauce. They were cooked over three hours, turned several times, always adding sauce on top each time. As usual, the drippings and sauces/sugars formed an eighth of an inch deep pool at the bottom of the tray, eventually drying, crusting, and burning to a crisp black. (The ribs turned out great, thank you very much.) After I removed the ribs, I let the tray cool to room temperature. When I went to remove the laurel, it pulled right out from the tray, leaving the blackened sauce and crusted foil behind (with a pretty cool leaf pattern). I started to soak it in water, but most everything floated right off. I was a little annoyed by the large number of nooks and crannies between the leaves and the indentation where the leaves meet the stem, but no scrubbing was necessary - just soapy sponge and even rubbing. I estimate cleaning time of the laurel compared to a typical rack to be about one-fourth as time intensive, and probably one-fiftieth energy intensive. The fact that it didn't get stuck to the sugar and fat hardened to a black tar like coating was impressive enough. This thing is great, and I'm going to get a lot of use out of it. I can't wait to try this during next summer's smoking season!

The second time around I decided to go big and it is working out ok. The problem with this company is that they seem incapable of producing a lid that fits correctly. You have to hold it in place when pouring (it doesn't fit snugly; one end always sticks up). Same thing occurred with first one I owned. And yes, they were that way right out of the package. Quality control is sorely lacking at Brita. But for the price, the filter does its job so it's an acceptable product and I will keep it.

12845	__label2__	1	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00DR5ZBX6	MIU COLOR&reg; 600ML Aroma Atomizer Air Humidifier LED Ultrasonic Purifier Diffuser (sandal wood)	I had high hopes....	I'm seriously into the wonderful qualities of Essential Oils, and I'm searching for diffusers to run pretty much full time throughout my house. First of all, I put filtered water into the two MUI Color 600ML diffusers I ordered. The instructions say to use tap water, but I don't even drink straight tap water, and I don't like the thought of diffusing chlorine, fluoride, etc. They shut off after about 5 minutes. So, I had to use tap water. I also don't like that the water to EO ratio is so high. By that I mean, the instructions call for 2 drops of oil in a full tank of water. I can hardly smell the oils I'm trying to permeate the house with for both the beautiful aromas as well as the healing powers. On the plus side, they run a long time, and they're sort of interesting looking. I wanted to put them on 24 hour timers, like 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off, but they don't work on timers because once they shut off, they turn back on only when the button is pushed. I contacted the seller about returning them, but since they actually run, I'd have to pay shipping, so I kept them. They're more of a humidifier than an oil diffuser, so I'll probably use them in winter.

1465	__label1__	4	N	Jewelry	B000PEINWS	14k Yellow Gold Akoya Cultured Pearl Stud Earrings (6.5-7mm)	Beautiful and dainty	I am a small woman with small ears so, the size of these earrings was perfect for me. They were beautiful and dainty. The color is exactly what I was going for (although the color of the pearl on the earrings was different than on the necklace). The problem was these earrings were so flimsy that they started to bend upon opening the lever-back. Not good. I was afraid I might rip my earring hole trying to get these off. If they weren't so malleable, they would be awesome.

Adheres well, dries fast. Just clean the brush right away after use. Don't let the brush dry out with this stuff still on it. Very hard to clean even with solvent. I paid the prize for being lazy, I guess.

It thought it was pretty good myself.<br /><br />Cooking was easy.  I just had to boil water.  The box said cook it for seven minutes.  I did it, and it was a little hard.  I cooked it some more for two more minutes and it was better that way.<br /><br />I like that the light color of the pasta and the fact that it doesn't stick.  I didn't tell anyone this is gluten free and no one noticed.  Asked how they liked it, my family gave it a thumbs up.

The slippers are well made, very comfortable, and stylish.  He LOVES them.  So glad we bought two pairs this time!

A chicken pot pie with this pan fed 5 adults and 5 kids. Crust came out kind of crunchy and I liked that.  Will have to use plastic utensils so as to not scratch it.

I had a lot of fun using it but it was bulky and hard to hold.  Maybe I have tiny hands.  My son wanted to use this so I let him try.  He's 11 and he really wasn't able to do much with it since he had to hold it with two hands but he had fun trying which is what is most important.  I wish this was rechargable so there wasn't a cord.  I did make some fun little things and after about 20 minutes I got the hang of it and it made it easier.  I will be buying more plastic for it because I do like it a lot and think that with some practice I will be able to make some pretty cool things.  There are just some design issues I wish could be addressed which is why I gave it three stars.

I have a hard time believing any positive review about this product because there is nothing good about it.<br /><br />The screen hardly registers your fingers and when it does is calibrated way off of center.<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money and get a decent tablet I did.

Out of the two bayonets, this one is more &#34;perfect&#34; because the blade is sharpened All the way to the point(unlike my 494 M7).

This product actually worked, and I can see a difference after using it for around a month every day. It doesn't smudge or give me panda eyes, yet it washes off easily. It's consistency is perfect, it applies smoothly and doesn't clump my eyelashes together. One or two layers is sufficient to ensure full coverage. I wear contact lenses and this mascara is perfect - I haven't had any problems with eye irritation. This is the best conditioning mascara I have ever tried and I am very happy with the purchase!

11407	__label2__	4	N	Home Improvement	B004NBVQ28	Select Step 5-Feet to 8-Feet 300-Pound Duty Rating Adjustable Step ladder	Lots to Love	There are a lot of things to love about this Little Giant Ladder:<br />+ The height of the front legs can be adjusted independently from the height of the back legs so that it can be placed on stairs.<br />+ The top standing platform is large, to provide full support to both feet.<br />+ The apex has a deep tray for holding small tools.<br />+ It comes with an Airdeck to attach above the apex that can be used as both a platform for supplies and a handrail (removable when not in use).<br />+ Included with the Airdeck are bungee cords for hanging tools off the platform.<br />+ It comes with wheels, so I can drag it around. (No, the wheels don't make contact with the ground when the ladder is open.)<br />+ The ladder is easy to open and close.<br />+ Feels solid on the ground, no worries about tipping.<br /><br />Some information that should be but never is provided with the specs for ladders: at its maximum height, the top standing platform is 67 1/2&#34; from the ground. Folded, the ladder is 5' tall and 27&#34; wide at the base.<br /><br />The Airdeck could use some improvement. It's supposed to provide more stability for us when standing on the top platform, but the wobble makes me feel a little nervous. My husband double checked to make sure it was installed correctly. He lost his balance on the way down and grabbed it for support. It held tight, worked like it's supposed to, but we'd both like it better if it felt more solid.<br /><br />Still, I do like this ladder. We use it to change the light bulbs in our chandeliers, which was always a difficult task before. My husband used to lean an old ladder against the wall and have me stand below to hold it. Now, he can do it all by himself.

2296	__label1__	3	N	Toys	B00IJVN0XQ	Littlest Pet Shop Say Ahh to The Spa Style Set	It is cute and the idea is great and all	I received this free from Hasbro and my daughter was thrilled to get it!<br /><br />It does come with a lot of pieces, however, most of these pieces are itty bitty tiny pieces that are referred to as &#34;deco pieces&#34;. They pop into the walls but only on on side. She didn't seem to mind that much though. I thought it was a bit strange after I finally figured out it is one-sided holes.<br /><br />The second thing about this set that sticks out is the sink that comes with it. It is cute and the idea is great and all, but it doesn't seem to have much use. My 6-yr-old daughter plays as if it isn't there. She does like the mask that came with the Little Pet Shop set. I was surprised that it actually does stay on the pet!<br /><br />The last thing about it that I have noticed - The wall mount on the bottom right (which is small cardboard) doesn't flatten out well so you can't really sit anything on it. I am unsure why they included this small &#34;surprise&#34; instead of just including a small side table or long-standing table.<br /><br />I would still recommend this to other parents but not without telling them about these things just in case. I was a bit disappoint by this set.

I was an early purchaser of the JOB 225, and like a number of other early purchasers of this amplifier, I had a problem with 60 Hz hum emanating from the loudspeakers. When I contacted JOB Electronics (apparently a marque of the ultra-high-end brand Goldmund), the company at first seemed skeptical that there was a problem with the amplifier.<br /><br />Once JOB/Goldmund acknowledged the problem, however, the response was swift. JOB paid for return shipping to Switzerland and had my amplifier back in my possession within two business days. The problem with 60 Hz hum was gone. Reportedly, other users with humming JOB 225s will be able to ship their amplifiers to a service center in NYC for repair/modification.<br /><br />The repaired/modified JOB 225 sounds spectacularly transparent. Adding this amp to my system has expanded soundstage width and depth, and increased image specificity.<br /><br />Before purchasing this amp, keep in mind both that output power is limited and that the amp generates a lot of heat. Use with electrostatic or other difficult-to-drive speakers should be ruled out. Use with truly high-end speakers nevertheless appears possible. One user has reported extraordinary results with TAD CR-1s.<br /><br />In all, I'm pleased with my purchase. I would have rated it five stars if not for the initial 60 Hz hum problem.<br /><br />NOTE ON SHIPPING: Though Amazon reports an estimated delivery time several weeks away, I and all other JOB 225 users with whom I've communicated received our amps in a couple of business days via FedEx International Priority. Yes, you get shipping at Amazon Prime speed from Geneva for $70.
13495	__label2__	4	Y	Electronics	B003GGXGU6	Jamo S 426 HCS 3 WENGE 5-Piece Home Theater System (Wenge)	Nice Sound	I have had these speakers for about a month now. So for they sound great but you will need a sub woofer to get the full home theater experience. They are a big upgrade from my Sony speakers. Still running on a Sony receiver that I need to upgrade to. The center speaker is the reason I bought these & the price was cheap for the hole setup can't beat it. Movies sound great vocals are clear and load now music sounds good to no complaints so far. Speakers are a nice size not to big not to small I thought the towers would  be to big for my room but everything worked out great are room measures 16x12. Wood color is nice better than the all black my opinion. If you are pondering on buying these do it the price is can't be beat for the quality made by klipisch.

It mounted quite easily using the sticky pads that came with it. The size is perfect for writing lists. Most stainless fridges aren't magnetic, so the magnetic surface of this board is very handy, as is the little clip on top that holds the dry-erase marker that comes with the board.

I got this TV after getting a different one here on Amazon that was just horrible. The speakers hardly worked and when they did it made a robotic sounding noise instead of playing the actual sound it was supposed to. Also, the screen would get fuzzy if I didn't mess with the HDMI cord that was plugged in. No matter which cord I used, the problem still occurred. All in all I just couldn't deal with it any longer in my living room.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting this TV here on Amazon, please think again --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nBMLlW<br /><br />I'm so glad I bought the Sony TV, I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over a month of using it. The sound is great and the picture quality is definitely awesome. I can't see how anyone gave it a bad review!<br /><br />I hope I was able to help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!

20653	__label2__	4	Y	Home Entertainment	B004OF9XGO	LG BD670 3D Wireless Network Blu-ray Disc Player with Smart TV	Great Product, But...	Setup was very easy.  Has a great array of premium services available (Netflix, HuluPlus etc.)  Connected with no issue to our wireless network and play via the services was great.  Menus are easy to navigate.  Playback from blu ray discs has been outstanding.  2 issues with this unit have nothing to do with the unit itself but with delivery.  The unit was packed inadequately in the shipping box with it being free to slide around.  Given the state of the shipping box, I would say it was subject to a good deal of abuse during the shipping process which leads me to wonder if damage has been done to the unit (none observed at this time but only time will tell).  Secondly, it took from 2/16 until 2/24 for the unit to arrive in the Rochester NY area from Pennsylvania via USPS.  Overly long shipping time and apparently one of the reasons why the packages looks as beat as it did (any wonder why USPS has issues?)  Would purchase this unit again but only if it not being shipped USPS.

I previously bought a pair of the 12x36 IS and love them. We are close enough to the waterway to sometimes read where the various boats are from. When there are several people visiting the one pair was not enough so I thought I would order an addtional pair that were more powerful. I was expecting more from the 18x50's. They are much larger and heavier. If you got a significant boost in magnification that would be fine, but I see very little increase in magnification. Only a loss of field of vision. I should have ordered another pair of the 12x36's.

I bought my first box of Lipton and I'm really impressed with the taste, especially for this price.  Just don't expect it to be able to hold ground with most of the premium teas out there, but for someone new to loose teas, I would recommend to them in a heartbeat.<br /><br />And if you like the taste of this Lipton black tea, I'd suggest also trying this sampler; [[ASIN:B00HC582FQ Organic Black Teas Loose Tea Trio Sampler - Earl Grey Crème, Sweet Almond Wild Berry, Pumpkin Spice Chai]].  A little different from the plain black teas, these are full-bodied and full of flavor...depending on the blend.<br /><br />This is why I love loos leaf teas sooo much.  Each one is different from the next, all with their own personality and flavor.  Oh and If you like pumpkin pie, you'll fall in love with the pumpkin spic chai in that sampler.  Simply to die for.

14420	__label2__	5	Y	Musical Instruments	B003B0I09Y	Mighty Bright 53510 Orchestra Light, Black (US Adaptor)	The End of All Darkness Worries	I used this for a theater gig while playing keyboard. The light not only brightened up every inch of the music on the stand but also my entire 88-key keyboard, without blinding a single audience member. The LED lights never produce heat, allowing me to adjust the light at any time without risk of burning myself. The flexible neck allows for any creative positioning imaginable, holding any position for an unlimited amount of time.<br /><br />If there is anything to critique, it is the clip itself, which doesn't hold quite as securely to my music stand as I would hope, though there is no risk of it falling off, it just may wiggle a bit. However, once it is set to my liking, it really only wiggles when I try to do so. No movement occurs just from setting a book on the stand or turning pages.<br /><br />Although I haven't used it for any purposes beside reading music, I'm sure other creative uses would prove effective as well. The option to either use AC power or batteries is very nice, as you don't need to waste battery power when you can conveniently plug it in. Keep a twist-tie or rubber band handy though, as the power cord is quite long.<br /><br />The bag is nice for storing and keeping off dust when not in use. I was attracted to the fact that the light uses cheaper AA batteries as opposed to the more expensive AAA or coin batteries, and it comes with the batteries, too. Considering the quality and all the accessories, I don't foresee needing to spend any bucks on this or any new light for quite awhile.

I like the Nintendo Wii Console; I just don't my experience on the first day of receiving it... TODAY, DECEMBER 2, 2013.  I was so looking forward to it and was excited to receive an e-mail that it had arrived at my front door.  I raced home from work to do to do my chores that I had planned on quickly just so that I would have time to really sit back, enjoy and read the instructions and actually get to know the Wii. In the first hour and and a half I had &#34;carefully&#34; (literally, since this is my first ever expensive game I bought for myself) unpacked the game and had hooked it all up.  I even connected the Wii to the internet, downloaded Netflix and started to watch a movie that I had started on my laptop a few days ago.  Everything was going great until... I decided to play &#34;Just Dance 4&#34;, the game came with the Wii Console, it was a bundle.  After all, why not try the game out since I was going to start working out to the game tomorrow that is why I actually but the console in the first place.  I started the game picked the song that I was going to dance to to and the entire console... JUST DIED!  It just &#34;cut-off&#34;!  Now the game is stuck inside the darn thing and I can't get it out!  I tried to unplug the power supply and wait a few minutes because that's what the trouble shoot instructions said to do but nothing. I had the game plugged to a wall surge protector.  I'M SO DEPRESSED!  I really wanted this Wii because it is so much fun.  Reminds me when I played this particular game with my niece.  I knew from that moment on that I wanted to own one not only because it is fun but because it is a great way to stay in shape.  So here I am almost 4 hours later requesting a return which I really wanted a replacement but no can do and writing a review all on the same day of receiving it.
2012	__label1__	1	N	Camera	B006P88VSE	Dropcam Wi-Fi Wireless Video Monitoring Camera	beware of a monthly recurring fee...	The cam was good, once I saw that it's the bestselling camera here, I bought it. However the problem with it was a recurring fee of $100 - $300 a month, which was used to pay hosting. The thing that you cannot download videos that you record without a subscription is disappointing and really not worth a price.<br /><br />My friend has a Samsung SmartCam ( http://amzn.to/1zrNtnA ) which was far more superior to this one. It didn't had such a problem and the thing that you can use videos to record anything you want for free is really something that's worth it.

I happened across this stripper while searching for something else & thought I'd give it a try. :)<br /><br />The pros:<br />+ Low cost & the shipping is free.<br />+ Good product reviews.<br />+ Very easy to use & preps my coax cables perfectly.  I should have got one of these years ago!<br /><br />The cons:<br />- The blades in the inner handle, specifically the ones for stripping data cables are dangerous!  My son cut his finger when he picked up the tool to look at it.  I removed those blades, as I don't need them.

They are machine washable, have a good enough seal, and look smashing. The price is very reasonable. It's tempting to pick them up by the lid, but not a good idea with heavier ones. These will definitely be prominent  in my new pantry.

Hard to eat just one that's why I buy the tub size.

So I got her this and told her that if her grandma needed her, she'll be there when called. Throughout that time, she kept telling me how wonderful the product was. So I guess I'm satisfied too!
19178	__label2__	4	Y	Electronics	B0001FTVEK	Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Dock	Solid buy Good for the Price range	Now these are not audiophile headphones. Not to say they don't sound good. They do. Pros and cons. Pros you can hang the base on the wall within reach of your favorite source, be it your tv or stereo or whatever and in my case, I have a stereo in the basement and TV and receiver upstairs. The reason I mention this is because. I sometimes hook the set downstairs, put on some cd's or vinyl and sit on the porch and they sound fine (about 30 feet distance) When the wife goes to bed, I connect to the T.V upstairs and listen to the game (loud). It comes with 1/4 adaptor and it comes off leaving the 1/8 inch which fits most computers etc. It has an adjustment setting (3 way) on the base for best frequency and a dial on the headset to make it more clear. In some cases it takes a few minutes to get the settings right. Which brings the Con (or one of them) The volume control is directly above where you adjust the frequency settings so if you're not paying attention you can accidently adjust frequency when you want to turn the volume up. The only other con is (and it's only because it isn't in the manual) is this. If you adjust the headset (as in pull one side down to adjust for your head, You have to put both sides all the way back up before putting the headset on the base for charging. Now this should be obvious but I adjusted my headset and was jamming and dropped the headset. When I went to charge them it wouldn't sit straight on the stand and I thought I bent them by dropping them. I even started pulling the headset a little so it would sit even on the base. It wasn't until I started really looking at the headset on the base where I did the (duh) and walked over and pushed both earpieces up and set it back on the base. It was fine. These are really comfortable as well. These are definitely worth the price and I would buy again. When playing audiophile quality don't expect them to perform like your speakers (if they are a good set) But you can also expect good quality sound for the price - They do the job.

I don't have time to play real D&D any more, the days on having 8 hours free on the weekend are long gone. But this is a nice alternative. It is basically D&D, but the player characters are set in advance. You don't have to look up stuff in guides, because info about armor class and damage and spells and such, are all on the playing cards. Nobody has to play the role of Dungeon Master, because the encounter/instructions tell you what all the monsters do, who they go after, etc. It is also random each time, because the way you place the board tiles and draw cards, it makes it different. There are a zillion parts/pieces, so I recommend you get a little case with subdividers to hold everything, or else get a bunch of ziplock bags.

Not to mention, we live on a dirt road, so every time someone drove by it almost sounded as if they were pulling in the driveway.<br /><br />After reading reviews on multiple products I decided to go with this long range Skylink kit. It was here in a matter of days and I had it setup within minutes. I screwed the sensor to the base of a tree 10' from the street and have the alarm in the kitchen.

11516	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B004T3QP44	Maxwell House International Coffee Hazelnut Cafe, 9-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)	Great flavor and another good way to enjoy any time of the day!	Maxwell House has another great International Coffee to enjoy and that is the Hazelnut Flavored Instant Coffee.  The flavor is not overwhelming with the taste of Hazelnut and that is good because some products out there (mostly creamers) can be overwhelming if you add it to coffee.  Maxwell House did good by the nice flavor but also you can taste the rich coffee as well.  I am very pleased that over the years Maxwell House has improved the flavor and the varities of their International Coffees.  In the 1970's and 1980's, there were only a few flavors of International Coffee and they also tasted very weak.  Well, they are now a pleasure to purchase due to the wide variety of flavors and the richness of the coffee's they sell.  Hazelnut is great to enjoy during the morning or whenever you want a good tasting coffee during the day or night.  Highly Recommended!
11382	__label2__	4	Y	Video Games	B003O6CB6S	Call of Duty: Ghosts - PC	It's awesome -- but don't expect to run it on your mom's 8-year-old Celeron notebook!	I really don't know what the reason is for all the hate for this game, but I think it's awesome.  However, I can guarantee you that you're not going to think it's awesome if your PC isn't up to specs.<br /><br />I've been a PC gamer since Wolfenstein, Doom, etc, so I started the COD series with...COD -- the original!  I've bought every COD game since then, and at times, yes, they ran horribly for me, but that was my fault for being a cheapo and not upgrading my system.  Sometimes, you just have priorities in life other than keeping the latest, greatest hardware in your PC, but when that happens you really shouldn't hate on the latest game(s) simply because you have an inadequate system.  Again, i want to emphasize -- I know.  I've been there.  I try to string along my PC hardware as long as I possibly can.  For the last six years I've been using a dual core in a MediaPC case that used to be my homemade DVR before I went with DirecTV.  I wasn't able to play the original Black Ops at all or even World at War.  All the Modern Warefare titles worked at mediocre (or less) settings.  Recently I decided it was time for a long past-due upgrade, so I built a Core i7-4770 based system with 16GB RAM, a GTX 660 w/2GB GDDR5, and Windows 7 x64.  Not the fastest/latest, but not a slouch system by any means.  It plays COD Ghosts at maximum everything video related as if it was a CGI movie.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed that the solo missions aren't there like in the MW titles, but I haven't really looked into all the multiplayer options, so there may be something in there that will entertain me after the campaign.<br /><br />In regard to all the one-star reviews, I guess I should thank you, as I highly suspect that's why the price was already lowered by $10 for this game when I bought it.  It's simple, folks -- update your system or don't buy the latest and greatest games and expect to play that with a maxed out configuration.  Welcome to PC gaming.  This isn't a gaming console that never needs upgrading.<br /><br />Edit:  They lost a star from me because there are no solo missions other than zombies, which I don't care for at all.

The colors I got varied, but THEY WEREN'T THE COLORS ON THE AD. Amazon shows these very light, pastel-like colors. I got bold greens, reds, blues, and purples.  I should know better than to purchase something so cheap, but this was ludicrous. The majority of them wouldn't “lock"" into place and the other ones take a ridiculous amount of strength to set. After doing some research, I found an even cheaper (and better quality) brand. Give Clover a shot and don't waste your time with these."

This bag is too large to fit inside my current luggage.  With all of its segments unzipped, this bag can hold a lot of stuff.  It offers little crushing protection so I would use it for coats, shoes, heavy items that are well-wrapped, and rolled clothing.  A similar smaller version of this bag survived four airplane flights with less than gentle handling with no damage.  I wish it had a pull strap.  This bag for such a low price is a real bargain.  I would strongly recommend this bag.

Goes around the body 3/4 of the way, then the belt tapers into a strip of elastic with a bra-strap style adjuster that hooks in the back. It looks ridiculous on a 5'9&#34; person that wears a size ten. If you are petite in every sense of the word, this may work for you. If you are over 5 feet tall, look elsewhere unless you like the minimalist approach.
9481	__label1__	5	N	Video DVD	B00BEZEDNU	GEORGE GENTLY COLLECTION: SERIES 1-4	Gently of the Yard	Martin Shaw's reserved homicide expect George Gently is a great foil for the period in history itself, early 60's England, when the Scandals of the Profumo affair and a growing cynicism with authority led to widespread police corruption and clashes between authority and youth. His partner, young John Bacchus, is on the verge of being a bent copper himself, with a penchant for abusing prisoners and cutting corners. Watching George try to keep Bacchus from making the mistakes other officers have made is key to how their relationship develops. The mysteries themselves are puzzlers and quite clever, with lots of red herring suspects and some contemporary undercurrents. A brilliantly written show.

12083	__label2__	4	Y	Automotive	B0002TP2C0	Schumacher SE-70MA 10 Amp Fully Automatic Deep-Cycle Charger	Works as described but gets very hot	I purchased to replace the dumb charger that came with cordless 24 volt lawn mower.  The charger that came with the mower did not shut its self off when the battery was fully charged, which means I had to time how long it was charging or cause damage to the battery. With the Schumacher the meter shows how much its charging (amps), and shows how it gradually reduces the charge as the battery reaches capacity, eventually shutting its self off.  No risk of over charging the battery.  The only negative is that the charger gets quite hot, even when it has charged the battery and essentially turns its self off.  For this reason I am hesitant to leave it connected to a battery long term, even thought it will not over charge the battery.  The 12 and 24 volt switch will also be handy for charging car batteries. The price was very reasonable compared to other chargers.

I thought I had &#34;flipped&#34; when I even considered this fountain for my cats much less decided to purchase it.  They have had a plastic fountain for a long time but I noticed they were drinking less even in the heat we are having and the filter just was not really up to par.  Well, we have had this fountain a week now and it is worth every penny it costs.  The fountain is heavy and even my 18 pounder does not push it around.  The water is so clear I cannot believe it and all I have been doing is refilling it, and there is no &#34;slimy&#34; feel to the sides or top of the fountain like the plastic.  It does cost a lot, at least to me, but I am truly glad I made this purchase for my very picky older pets. They love it too. Also, it comes very well packaged both by the manufacturer and then Amazon makes sure it is even safer.

Never had used an antminer, or any network based miner before, and was a bit worried at shelling out this much money on something I had no experience with. I ordered on the 5th, got to my door on the 8th, started mining within 30 minutes of taking it out of the box, and it was the first time I had set one up, I am not very tech savvy either. It didn't come with instructions, but they were easy to find via google. I would have had it running within 10 minutes had I known the power supply needed to be slightly modded with a paperclip in order to turn on when not connected to a motherboard. But now its all working wonderfully on a corsair cx500 psu ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0092ML0MY/ ). I had no idea what kind of bandwidth these would use, and had worried that my normal home connection would not be enough. Happy to report that my basic cable internet can support well over 50 of these, if I am doing the math right. Now that I found that out, I am going to be ordering several more so I can enjoy some Th/s speeds.

I guess it was just a bad model or something, prints well for documents, NOT pictures, oh and the ink? $80 for all 4 cartridges, and if you print a lot in color, you will go through them like water. Oh and the best part. it seems, though connected via WiFi, that 75% of the time, its “offline"" and needs to be rebooted. 2 stars and save your money."

As soon as I saw this particular piece, I had to have it for work.  I generally use my inexpensive pieces for work, as I am a teacher and it is amazing how quickly clothing and bracelets/watches can get damaged in the classroom.<br /><br />The watch arrived promptly, before the estimated shipping date, and was packaged really well.  Upon opening the package, I was surprised by the lovely quality of the watch - especially at the excellent price.  It was a lovely, matt gold colour and quite decently weighty.  The diamonds just add a nice touch of glamour.  In fact, I have had lots of compliments about this watch from friends who have thought it was a more expensive brand.<br /><br />My only criticism would be the size of the strap - it is huge!  Although, it is quite easy to take a couple of links out - so it is not a huge criticism.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this watch to anybody looking for a fashion piece at a reasonable price.

I had even thought about a return issue. I ordered this as a birthday gift to my son. He has a DJI F550 hexacopter. If it did not work well, I have no other choice but return. However, my son loved it. He always do the assembly for those things, so it was quite a easy thing for him to put this kit on his hexacopter. The parts were not flimsy, but quite solid. It had strong legs. The mounts are made by alumimum. That was a reason I chose this, because it really looked better than those made by cheap plastic.And its color sexied up the quad's looks, was pretty as the descritiopns. And it had a battery tray and camera gimbal holder, quite convenience. My son loves it, and I love too. Recommended.

Best face moisturizer I've been able to find so far. Makes my skin baby butt smooth, has helped clear up any minor breakouts I've had and most importantly, didn't break me out or make me oily. Don't bother wasting money on the expensive department store type marula oil. They are chock full of chemicals and silicone( this is what makes you're skin feel smooth in those products, and also clogs the crap out of your pores) this oil is very light, doesn't have an unpleasant odor like some other oils I've used (hemp seed oil works great but smells hideous) and in a pinch one pump will moisturize your hands like they have never been moisturized before. Seriously cannot say enough good things about this product.

I will lightly compare this bike trainer with my CycleOps JetFluid Pro Trainer. I understand these two trainers are not in the same league and same design, but my initial reaction to this trainer is good.<br /><br />Positives:<br />- Easy setup.<br />- Good solid build and lighter weight.<br />- Remote control for the adjusting the tension.<br />- Excellent skewer locking design.<br />- Included riser block.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- No feet height adjustments.<br /><br />I will take this for a ride this weekend and I will update my review regarding performance and noise levels compared to a fluid trainer. For now checkout the side by side photos of the Minoura MagRide and CycleOps.

I have shoulder length hair that is very thick. The curls lasted for a few days of brushing and styling. They might have lasted longer but I washed my hair. $2 a bottle is a pretty sweet deal. I would definitely buy again.

I found it hard to believe that anything could be as good as she said. Then one Christmas her sisters got together and sent her a box of these Butterscotch Krimpets. I tried them and I immediately fell in love with them. The smooth, creamy butterscotch flavored frosting is delightfully sweet and tasty. And the light yellow cake is moist, fluffy, and also rich in flavor. Tastykakes are definitely superior to the other brands.
18773	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B004E4ERHA	Coleman 6-Person Instant Cabin Tent	Perfect Tent	As first time campers, and generally indoor people, my husband and I selected this tent to take on his son's first Boy Scout Camping Trip. We got the tent quickly, and when it came time to set it up at the campsite, we were able to do it easily. I watched a few of the videos on You Tube so I'd have some idea of how to do it, but the directions were easy to follow on the inside of the tent case.<br />When we got ready to pack up and head out, in a bit of a rush, breaking down the tent and getting it back into the case was super simple - the case itself is a little bit large so that you can get it back in without having to fold it map-like to be exactly the same as it came out. Most of our trouble was trying to get the air out of the tent that had been trapped in it when we took it down.<br />We had a tarp over it through some serious rain and wind, so I can't vouch for leaking issues, but we had a great trip and this tent was a big part of that.<br />I was VERY pleased with this tent.

18215	__label2__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B001Q7N1Z2	First Act MX051 Guitar Stand	Solid and reliable for holding your instrument	My brother has been playing bass guitar for the past few years and every six months or so, I see him tossing another busted stand into the trash. I asked him why he was going through them so quickly and he told me its because he keeps buying the cheap plastic kind because he thinks that's all he needs. Well after going through three of them in the span of six months, I knew I had to intervene and provide a little guidance and assistance. I did my research and found this little guitar stand not only provides an amazing amount of durability but also the best bang for your buck.<br /><br />When I purchased this item, I wanted to see how strong it was. I had already visited the local music store to compare. They started at $30 and shot all the way up to $100. Now I know musicians love to display their instruments but a hundred bucks is where I draw the line. When I saw this priced at under $20, I knew that was a fair amount but it wasn't until I held it in my hands that I was convinced this was far superior to any of the others I had ever sampled. This stand is made from pure steel and not some composite aluminum material found in the department stores. It's very tough and has a good weight to it. I would feel very comfortable hanging a 10lbs+ instrument on it. I tried to bend it gently and quickly realized it would take a lot more strength than I could expend at that moment to even put a dent into it. It is extraordinarily durable and for such a low price, I was astonished. I couldn't believe my brother would spend so much money on inferior stands when a pure gem was sitting under his nose the entire time.<br /><br />Musicians stress the importance of keeping their instrument in a safe and secure place when not in use and I can see why. My brother would flip out if I put his bass on his bed let alone the floor. If it wasn't in his hands it had to be on the stand. Comparing this stand to the other ones available is almost a joke. For the price, it can't be beaten. You're not only buying a solid piece of steel but also investing in the longevity of your equipment, and not to mention, this thing looks absolutely gorgeous holding up my brother's bass.<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying a new instrument or just replacing your current stand, you need to purchase this product. With all of the money you've already invested into your guitar/bass you'll definitely need a quality piece of equipment to keep it safe. This should be the first, last, and only stand you'll ever need...  Unless of course you've got multiple instruments. I feel much safer with this stand holding up my brother's bass than with any of the other ones out there. And for less than $20, this is the best value and ultimate compliment for your instrument.

My boys bedroom has a blanket which matches the blue in this and his room is a smidgen dark so you can't tell quality etc. It is a simple curtain, blocks light, although you can see pinholes in the daylight so not true blackout. It does seem to reduce road noise. We live on a Parkway. So it works but nothing fabulous looking but not ugly.

I had hoped for something more like Kinsey Milhone who is sharp and interesting or Dixie Hemingway who also lives in the Key West area and has survived a terrible tragedy to try to make a new life for herself.  After reading over half this book I simply didn't give a rat's ass about this woman. However, it finished better than it started and I hope the next book which I already have will show her to have matured enough to not be so annoying. My main question is ""if she doesn't have a job, is living off the charity of a friend, etc., how can she run around spending so much money all the time."" Yes, Key West is a charming locale. Now,what we need is a charming heroine."
2155	__label1__	3	N	Books	111828917X	PHR / SPHR: Professional in Human Resources Certification Study Guide	Book is ok	As one previous reviewer pointed out, the question formatting was less than optimal as the questions were at the beginning of each section and subsequently followed by the answers (hard not to cheat). Suggestion - locate the answers at the end of the chapter/text. Also, this may just be me, but the questions should come after the related section's literature not the other way around.<br /><br />Comprehensive but still lacking. When I took the exam I found myself cursing the review book as a great deal of information on the exam was never mentioned in this text. I had to reach into the deep recesses of my mind (sca ry) to retrieve some gray/foggy/probably incorrect information to answer some of the questions. Now, I know that cramming two years of full time graduate study into so many pages isn't feasible. So, I would suggest to future candidates to briefly (and I mean briefly) skim their graduate texts before dedicating majority of their time to this text.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that it was weird to have the practice questions in the beginning of each chapter, and that it doesn't give you a clear idea on how you do on the content unless you're really good at the honor system.<br /><br />What helped me the most were these 2 books<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/SPHR-Exam-Prep-Professional-Resources/dp/0789736764/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1344537422&sr=8-4&keywords=sphr<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BABSJW

16481	__label2__	5	N	Books	0881462713	A Death at the White Camellia Orphanage	"Notes while reading ""A Death at the White Camellia Orphanage"""	"I've finally had a chance to read the first couple chapters of Marly Youmans' Death at the White Camellia Orphanage. People will inevitably call it Faulknerian - it's Deep South, it's hot, it's told through the lens of a boy who's neurologically atypical. And it's got fruit and blood. But if you have any spiritual antennae at all, you'll quickly grasp that it's anti-Faulkner. There's fullness, not emptiness, in back of everything.<br /><br />And the story is backwards, too. Christianity first made its way by claiming the crucifixion and resurrection as the answer to evil. But this novel turns that upside down: in this the novel the crucifixion (at least) is the evil that must be answered. Pip knows at once, in his chaotic, inarticulate way, that everyone is responsible for the death of his brother. The question is, how do you find your way, hobbled with knowing that? Christianity here is the question, not the answer.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />'""Light,"" he whispered. He would collect, slowly and laboriously, a sufficient radiance.'<br /><br />So Pip's story goes on, to the scary parts: where he goes about collecting light. Of course he does, because that's what human beings do: but Pip's working under such a deficit that he has no real thought for what it's going to do to other people, and to himself eventually, if he simply makes up his own rules and plunders it. Here's where the book turns into a book about me, and I find myself reluctant to pick it back up: at twilight the camellia on the cover hovers like a ghost on the end table.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />It takes a long slow weary time to become human, for some of us. ""I preach the Church of the Bitter End and the news of your guilt, boy."" I'm loving Marly's White Camelia: the story of Pip's slow coming-to-humanity cuts close to the bone, for me. It's always been too easy for me to cut free of ties, to shrug and wonder if any of it matters, really, to lose myself in the sheer welter of the senses, the building of patterns and their collapse.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I don't often read novels about myself. Oh, sure, all novels are about me: I am Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, and Ishmael - not to mention Rochester and Micawber and Ahab - and so are you; but that's only because we all are. It's only once in decade, maybe, that I meet myself in a novel in a more personal way, so as to turn red and plus myself non: I didn't know anyone knew this about me. Tolstoy wrote a monstrous great novel about me, calling me Pierre Kirillovich Bezukhov; Trollope once gracefully eviscerated me under the name of Bertie Stanhope. But no one had written about my childhood and coming-of-age, which was a grimmer story than either Tolstoy or Trollope had in mind. Suppose you are a boy of ferocious will and intense desire. Suppose there is an early overwhelming loss, a hole where the center of your life should be. Suppose what is difficult for other people is easy for you, while what's easy for them is impossible: you can solve quadratic equations in your head, but you can't remember the names of the other kids in your classroom. Suppose the sensual world is overwhelming, full of beauties and patterns, while the social world is full of puzzling, trivial detail. Suppose you are awkward, clumsy, irritating: and yet, when whispering time comes, possessed of an eldritch capacity for persuasion. Suppose your own vulnerabilities are so different from other people's that you regularly wound, and are wounded, without anybody meaning any harm. How do you grow up? And how do you recover from a deep, precocious understanding of evil, which - for all your immaturity - marks you as old?<br /><br />Well, by blundering about, and doing a fair amount of damage; by lots of dumb luck, and by the grace of strangers who are extraordinarily generous and kind. That's my story, and it's Pip Tatnall's too. I cared enough about the outcome of this novel that when I was twenty pages from the end I suddenly stopped, and put off finishing it for several days. I was afraid it would end badly, and I couldn't have stood that.<br /><br />It doesn't end badly. But 'nuff said."

11828	__label2__	5	N	Kitchen	B00004SGFH	KitchenAid FGA Food Grinder Attachment for Stand Mixers	From mixer to mincer	"I have been interested in making my own sausage for a while now, which meant I needed a meat grinder.  I was tempted by those big metal hand-cranked grinders just because they look cool, but finally decided on function over form and got this Food Grinder attachment for my KitchenAid, along with the [[ASIN:B00004SGFQ Sausage Stuffer]].  I know that this grinder has been hit-and-miss with a lot of people.  I did some research on how best to use it, and followed the advice of chilling both the meat and the grinder before use.  I cut my meat into small, serviceable chunks and I was ready to go.  I am happy to report that I am on the ""hit"" side of hit-and-miss.  Both the grinder and sausage stuffer worked just fine, and I had a great time making my sausage.  Granted, everything wasn't entirely smooth; it took some practice and experience to get used to just how much meat I could put in the grinder at once, how fast I could run the mixer, and how much pressure I could exert on the plunger to keep the meat grinding steady into the sausage casings.  If I pressed to hard or went to fast, the meat had a tendency to squish up the sides.  I did have a slight residue of that famous ""food safe grease"" on the grinder after I was finished, but it was a tiny amount and didn't get on the meat.  I wonder if chilling the actual grinder before using it helped out with that problem?  Either way it washed off easily.  I wouldn't recommend the ""KitchenAid Food Grinder"" for anyone doing heavy-duty mince-making.  This is not a commercial-grade product, and doing more than a few pounds is going to take a long time.  But for someone like me who just wants to add a new menu item to what can come out of their kitchen, it works just fine."

I was expecting this thing to fully mate with car; it does not. Yes, it stays in place and does work but a small wiggle will cause it to stop working. For something that is used VERY little, and its ability to quickly move between cars, its well worth it.  Also, I discovered you cannot get features out of this that Honda restricts. One example is MPG. Honda blocks that data thus will not be displayed. This seems specific to Ridgeline, but is likely true to any other make/model that manufacture does not want these settings known. Ridgeline was blocked because the MPG is so low (< 17) they don't want easy to find.  Just my opinion.

Love it!

Got this cutting board and immediately like it better than my other mats.  It is a good weight and doesn't slide around on the counter.  It also has a little channel around the edge to help with juicer fruits.  I would definitely get this mat again.

20627	__label2__	4	N	Books	988988870X	The Third Ear	A little dated, but still worthwhile	In 2012, this book is a little dated and is a little long winded, but is still a worthwhile read.<br /><br />While some of the stories are a little cheesy, long, and at times, seemingly irrelevant - the overall message of the book is to 'get out there and start speaking the language you want to learn' and that's a great message.<br /><br />He's tried to make his book fit all purposes - principles for people learning any language.  I feel like he has cast his net too wide with this approach.  He should have just written a book that was for English speakers trying to learn Chinese, as this what he knows best.<br /><br />Anyway, while the book is not perfect, it did encourage me to speak Chinese more and to move out of my comfort zone.  I'm now trying to speak Chinese every day and look for opportunities to do so.  Before, I read this book I was too afraid.  So, for that, I give it four stars.

I have also seen the 705HD in action Projector works great with lighting. I have four large windows surrounding the screen and I still get great HD picture.. Dark movies may require to dim the room alittle in the daytime. I am beyond satisfied with my projector so far. Make sure you mount your projector at night to ensure the keystones (picture sizing) will fit. It's just amazing.
4812	__label1__	5	Y	Beauty	B00PABCT76	Epique Beauty Wrinkle Cream - Anti Aging Moisturizer - Best Anti Wrinkle Face Cream with Matrixyl,shea Butter - Day and Night for Women and Men	Potent formula. I am getting good results!	So far, great results.<br />I've been using Epique for about 6 months now and have seen definite improvements with my skin and the dryness. My skin tone looks more even and with less spots and blotches. The area around my lower cheekbones is more firm and has a lifted, tighter look.<br /><br />The bottle is an oz. Since using this I have barely used even 20% and that's with a twice a day application. It takes very little to moisturize with this and just a tiny amount will do in my opinion. It works well enough for just one pump.<br /><br />When applying to my face I did notice that it rubs in well and absorbs really quickly. It is not sticky nor does it leave a greasy feeling as some moisturizers do. I do not have many wrinkles though I did see improvement on my forehead where I have a deep line from a bad habit of squinting, it has faded a bit and is not so pronounced anymore.<br /><br />I didn't have any bad side effects or skin sensitivity with this or clogging of my pores. My face overall is smoother and soft after using this. I would recommend to other people based on my experience with it.

I can't find these bulbs anywhere locally. Wal*Mart used to have them, but they haven't had them for weeks. The hardware stores and grocery stores don't have them either. I'm happy to find them at any price.
11394	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00BG8F0NC	Monopoly Empire Game	The Empire is Back	If the classic game of Monopoly seemed to take too long, then you will appreciate this newer, shorter version. Instead of B&O Railroad, it is updated with businesses and brands like Spotify, ebay, Intel, Xbox, McDonalds and Coke. Instead of zipping around the board with an iron or a dog, you have a choice of a gold token like a coke bottle, game control, French fries, and motorcycle among others.<br /><br />You choose your token, roll the dice and start buying brands, add brands to your tower, and buy and trade and take over brands with empire cards.  First to the top of the tower wins. The game board reminds me of Times Square in appearance a bit.<br /><br />Contents include: 4 towers for up to four players, 6 tokens, 30 billboard tiles, 6 office tiles, 14 chance cards, 14 empire cards, money pack, 2 dice and the game guide.  I like this shorter, express version.  I used to call the classic version Monotony, partially because my brother always beat me at it because I virtuously would save all of my $$$ and he would spend his buying up all of the real estate in the first half of the game.  In the second half, I would just go around the board and pay him rent for hours on end until I ran out of $$$.  Not a good strategy on my part.<br /><br />I think this new version will be a hit for families who want a quick, fun game for family game night.  It has current, relevant brands which is fun.  And not all of the brands are about material consumption: there's ebay which is great for selling and recycling, and spotify which is about listening to good music for free - although they may charge a nominal price down the road.<br /><br />While it involves luck more than strategy, some of my favorite games as a child involved luck: Chutes and Ladders, Candyland, Parcheesi etc.  This is just a fun, light game for families to enjoy.  When my son comes home for the weekend - he was a board game designer and now video game designer - will get his opinion and let you know what he thinks.

I'm the type that has cold cathode light kits in my computer case. So when I saw what he did with lighting up the desk, I had to do the same. Techni Mobili needs to send Joe a commission check.<br /><br />Like other folks who had posted reviews, this took a few hours to complete. Nothing too complex. Nothing broken/damaged. I took off one star because my corner glass piece isn't level with the two side glass pieces. I'm sure I can fix it though.

16237	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B00525QKMK	Julia's Eyes [Blu-ray]	Wonderful Story and Thrilling Journey	This is yet another wonderful Spanish film that weaves a truly masterful storyline.  The acting is excellent.  I truly love the lead actress.  The story has an eerie and thrilling edge, and as is so typical of Del Toro, you really don't know where the tale is leading you until that one 'Ah-ha' moment... and then it all falls into place.  I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in a solid film, or if you are a fan of genres such as 'thrillers'.<br /><br />If you like Guillermo Del Torro, you will certainly love this film.

I have trouble holding 5 gallon cans full of gas. But this simple pump takes all the work out of pouring gas into my lawn equipment and generator. It even reaches all the way to the bottom of the 5 gallon can. The pumps that I have tried do not work with gasoline and the pumps would leak after the first use.

It is advertised as a boar bristle brush. An honest assessment would reveal that this brush contains approximately 5% boar bristle. It has a classic look and its performance is acceptable. I've only used it for a week, so I cannot speak to the durability. With free shipping and the fact that this was under $6, makes this a fair deal, the description should be more forthcoming though. It does note that it contains plastic bristles....

I was really surprised by the power and speed that this has. I've played with a few in the toy store that cost more money and they all seem sluggish with mediocre sound effect and no smoke. The sound effects on this set are impressive and my son loves the smoke feature. The train set seems plenty durable but the engine has a lot of little detail pieces that could be broken easily if your child is very rough with it. My son loved the train so much that he had to sleep with the engine tonight!! :)

4734	__label1__	5	N	Books	030746363X	The 4 Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat Loss, Incredible Sex and Becoming Superhuman	Fantastic Book!	I love Tim Ferriss' book and it really shed light on some simple things that can be done to lose weight. Tim stresses that you need to avoid white carbs, eat the same few meals over and over, don't drink calorie laden drinks, don't eat sugars and take one day off per week. The book also recommends the PAGG supplement system which is pretty good. I have used the Dr. Oz recommended supplement Slenderfruit-7 [[ASIN:B00IWV0AUO Slenderfruit-7 weight loss and appetite suppression diet pills]] and have had dramatic weight loss in using Tim's diet guidelines and this product. I highly recommend this book.

The wider silicone ends of the tongs allow you to grasp what ever it is you are trying to grasp and there is much less dropping of food. The silicone padded handles make them extremely comfortable to use. Also, the handles are wide and hefty enough to enable the user to get a good grip and keep it. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a quality silicone tongs at a reasonable price. The silicone feels great in your hand and they are easy to use. The color is a nice red. I also bought the other utensil sets that are made by this company: the Silicone Kitchen Utensils Set (5 Piece) - Hygienic Solid Silicone Design - with the whisk and basting brush; and the Premium Silicone 5-piece Silicone Utensil Set (5 piece) with the ladle and slotted spoon and regular spoon.

The only problem that i had is that the parts that go around your ear don't go completely around, they kind of sit on top of your ears and are a little bit tight. The plastic isn't very giving so it makes them a little tight around your head. Other than that, considering the low price they work well. Although if you are looking for headphones similar to ""turtle beach"" these aren't what you want."

Not going to do anything due to price but I ordered a set of two of these and one I will not be able to use as it is missing a lobster claw so I cannot attach it to a chain.  I do like the idea of this, in fact, I have it on a necklace I am wearing right now but be aware it is a box chain extender which means if you are wearing any other chain but a box chain and this portion becomes visible it may look a little funny.  To me the main thing is the convenience of being able to have a longer chain but more importantly to be able to easily clasp the magnets together rather than getting frustrated by trying to attach a lobster claw or spring ring to a tiny clasp.

I've been using media player for a number ...	Works great!I've been using media player for a number of years and this little Crenova1080P media player just came to my attention the past few weeks because I was looking for a new one to buy for my new apartment. This player is very small, and truly a portable player you would like to carry around on your trip. This little player provides a full spectrum of support almost all video formats in the market place today and up to 1080P HD level. It is extremely easy to setup (it is basically plug and play !). Quality of the play back video is excellent. With this low price, one cannot resist to having this little play in your pocket. Unless one is looking at additional features such as internet access. Since I bought the first one two weeks ago, I've already bought the second one for my travel needs. A great buy for a great price.

They are having trouble understanding how one package out of three ordered arrived open and empty.  I don't understand their confusion--the glue that held the blister to the cardboard dried out and the product fell out as someone packed it--or someone kept one and sent 2 thinking no one would complain.  I complained.  I paid for 3 and I expect to get 3!

15014	__label2__	5	N	Video Games	B002BSC55M	PSPgo - Piano Black	PSP go is the best! Learn how to legally get all the games.	The majority of the people who say negative things about the psp go probably never even touched the thing. I have one and I'm very impressed by it. People, shut the hell up with you shit talk. If your disappointed because the PSN doesn't have all the psp games or because the games are more expensive, I don't blame you. I was disappointed until I found out about a legal way to play all of the psp games on the psp go. No it's not free unless you already have the game you want in UMD format. Buy the game disc, or ask a friend to give you any unwanted psp games. Then, get a CUSTOM FIRMWARE for your psp go. Using custom firmware is completely legal. Next, download the backup files of the games you bought/ were given. Search up how to play iso's on a psp if you don't already know. Before you start thinking that this is illegal, let me say one thing. IT IS NOT ILLEGAL! As long as you have the original disc (new, used, or even broken for god sake), it is legal to play the backups. Now that way you pay less, and get all the games that were released for the psp. There you have it. Now you have less to whine about, maybe nothing at all anymore. The PSP go is the perfect portable system. You get a massive amount of built in memory space ( perfect for games, music, etc.). The small size is perfect to fit in your pocket. All in all, this is the perfect handheld.

While I understand that I cannot fully review a product like this in this short amount of time there are some things that I already don't like about it which has me reconsidering this purchase in the first place.  First off all I ordered this via prime 2 day shipping. It took 4 days to arrive.  Strike one.  Secondly, the way this product is already making me feel from this short amount of time really worries me (i.e. irritable at work, easily flying off the handle at people, little things bug me more than usual, etc etc).  Strike two.  Now if these feelings of irritably and aggressiveness translate into a better workout in the gym and better overall gains, I might change my review, but for now other than some extra energy this product is causing me to be pissed off more than anything else

I simply had a bunch of Macy's store credit and gift cards with no better place to go than on some new cans. I figured they would be disappointing but passable and that's exactly what they are.  I hope this review was helpful!

I'm bummed but they have to go back.
6378	__label1__	5	N	Home	B00XBRYFVY	bObsweep PetHair Robot Vacuum Cleaner and Mop, Rouge	Our new robot assistant	The good: -Battery lasts more than 1.5 hours and it is more than enough for BOB to cover the whole place multiple times over -Great with dog hair -Always returns to charging station which seems to be an issue for some other owners based on the reviews I had read prior to purchase. We have a straight forward floor plan with a large rectangular living room/kitchen and two bedrooms on each end. We have put the charging station is the living room and Bob has never missed it! The bad: The kitchen table is Bob's biggest challenge (and my biggest annoyance with Bob). He somehow manages to get under there sometimes and tries to get out some other way to no avail. When I am not there, I don't notice the struggle and Bob eventually seems to gets out as I have never found him dead there. but if I am there, Bob's dumb moves and prolonged helplessness (I have even observed a 10-minute struggle once) get on my nerves.

It is not too tight and can be adjusted. It covers very well and does not allow light in. The elastic strap does not cause discomfort on the back of your head nor does it entangle your hair.

And some of the files we were moving were huge and took forever to load into Creative Suite. I started thinking of other options. Buy a new laptop..? Or make a fix somehow. After searching the internet I stumbled on a great article that you can load your OS on a SSD drive and move the optical drive out to create more space for a SSHD. I was overjoyed with the prospect and took my baby apart with a tool kit and followed the instructions to a tee. Now my MBP boots up in less than 17 sec, and opens multiple applications rapid fast. Make sure to max your RAM while you do the operation and rest assured you have a few more years on your machine. Place your files that are media related on the other drive and you are golden. I will NEVER go back to the &#34;moving parts HHD&#34; ever again. It's like a Ferrari under the hood and tons cooler than that overheating spinning disc. Now they are getting more affordable now is the chance unless you are going for the &#34;upgrade&#34; that you can't upgrade.

13222	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B00NT5NR2G	The Inside	... off this review by stating THE INSIDE is a nice surprise. Because of its premise	I have to start off this review by stating THE INSIDE is a nice surprise.  Because of its premise, I wanted it to be good.  I buy movies from pawn shops on a frequent basis, and therefore I’m familiar with what many of them sell.  As I’ve perused the stores, I’ve sometimes wondered if the owners ever find forgotten video tapes inside of video cameras or forgotten DVDs inside of DVD players.  Director Eoin Macken uses this premise and sends the viewer on a nightmarish ride into hell.  The result is a wicked and intense movie experience that is both haunting and satisfying.<br /><br />I do have to give a warning about this film, however:  most of it is shot in first-person POV from a handheld camera.  Because of this, there are many shaky and dizzying shots.  People who became motion-sick from movies like CLOVERFIELD and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT will probably want to stay away from this film.<br /><br />THE INSIDE is well made overall, and looks great from a production standpoint.  It is actually a hybrid movie, in that it combines found-footage with actual third-person POV shots.  I like this aspect, as it allows you to immerse yourself in what is going on…but it also lets you take a breather every once in a while when the intensity gets too amped up.<br /><br />And speaking of intense, this film does not let up.  It takes a few minutes for the plot to unfold, but when it does, you’d better buckle your seatbelt.  When things start to happen, they move at a shotgun blast pace.  I particularly like how linear everything is; there are no flashbacks or pauses for reflection.  When the proverbial crap hits the fan, the viewer is held spellbound until the credits start to roll.<br /><br />The acting in THE INSIDE is very good as well.  I hate to admit I do not recognize any names in the cast list, but I will wager they will definitely do well in future endeavors.  Likewise, the special effects are pretty good, too, although there are not many of them.<br /><br />If I were forced to find a flaw with THE INSIDE, I would have to say the lack of explanation for the supernatural aspects disappoints me a bit.  It’s nothing at all that detracts from the film for the most part, however I, personally, would have liked a little more ‘meat’ in this area.<br /><br />Still, THE INSIDE is hell of a thrill ride, and horror fans should give this one a look soon.  I will be hosting a giveaway for a DVD copy of this film as well, so be sure and check that out after you finish reading this review.  Otherwise, the film is available now in a variety of formats.
1919	__label1__	3	Y	Video DVD	B000ELJ3JE	Beginning Pilates for Dancers - Get the Dancer's Body	Not Bad, Just Not For Me	It was okay. I was pleased to see that the video wasn't boring and the people on it didn't seem like robots like most exercise videos I have tried. The music was good as well. The DVD itself was very inspirational, I just think it's more than I am ready to commit to. So, I am taking points off for that. t contains 24 exercises that work on your shoulders, abs, obliques, legs, and glutes. I have no doubt that the program works, but it has to be something you're committed to. It's not something you can do for like 5 minutes a day and end up with a dancer's body. It's a satisfying, total body workout. A friend of mine used the system and she's looking amazing. I just don't have the discipline. So, if you're dedicated, then I'm sure you will look great. If it's a half-hearted attempt then there's probably another option.

I went through 4 different sizes and 3 makes of wire cup brushes. They all did a spectacular job of quickly removing old weathered wood and leaving a good finish in preparation for painting or staining. I tried a 3, 3.5, 4, and 5 inch brushes. The 3 inch proved to be the best for the four-inch angle grinder. The Weiler and the Forney brushes gave good service. The DeWalt brush failed and lost bristles very quickly. Price does matter. If you're thinking of using this tool for this application, be sure to wear long sleeves and a face mask. At the end of the day your clothes will be full of bristles.

I am spoiled and can't drink coffee anywhere else or any other brand!	I think this coffee is best.  I am spoiled and can't drink coffee anywhere else. I stand longingly over the coffee pot. Urging the coffee pot to go faster.. I am thankful that I can order this from Amazon. Thanks!  I have found that water quality enhances the taste of this coffee even more.  Water from brita pitcher, is what I use, to make this outstanding coffee.   I must take coffee with me every where I go, I can longer just pick up a cup anywhere else.  And the low acidity of the coffee keeps away in stomach or heartburn issues.. Give it a try and you will be pleased!! .
19888	__label2__	3	Y	PC	B006XGCQ2U	Acer Iconia A200-10g16u 10.1-Inch Screen Tablet - Titanium Gray	Beware - Do Not Purchase!	I purchase this tablet Feb. 2012. The tablet has worked all fine and great until just recently. When I say recently I mean 2 weeks after the 1 years warranty expired. It also seems many other users/customer are experiencing the same problem. The problem is the screen or digitizer goes crazy, and it appears the glue used to hold it down isnt good enough, like at the bottom edge. the screen becomes un usable.. apps opening on their own, cant press keys or letters on keyboard. as with other users its same symptoms along the bottom edge of screen is problem. press there slightly and apps will open close etc etc. I contacted Acer support, no recalls, no known defects known of this type..support rep, said my warranty expired, and basically SOL. So I paid for this tabled 350$ used it maybe 6 times when traveling over past year now it is junk. Unacceptable!! Contacted Acer support again requested to speak with level 2 support. Finally they admitted that this is a known problem and would repair the tablet at no cost to me and even though its passed out of warranty.
9625	__label1__	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B00KTUFMT0	RockBirds F7 Mini Portable EZCAST	The Best !	RockBirds New Mini Ezcast Streaming media player is a great way to stream video and pictures to my television from my iPad or iPhone.  I am now able to send Youtube, Netflix, or even browse my iPhone photos and videos to my television for my whole family to enjoy.  It is easy to use, and sends a nice quality stream via my wifi network.  This is so much cheaper then buying a Roku or similar device.  I find it comparable to Google's Chromecast.  I don't know what I did without it!  I love that it can also be used with a projector and other media devices as well.  I was even able to download an app that let's me broadcast content from my laptop to my television.  Wonderful device at a wonderful price!

I bought a new phone and did not go back to the otter box. It did need a kickstand and its necessary if your watching videos.
18280	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B00DNHMN8Y	Energizer 7 LED Headlamp (115 Lumens)	Excellent! Performs exactly as required.	Had a similar unit a few years ago that eventually disassembled itself through sheer use. This one ups the ante with the addition of a strobe mode and a wider headband although the tilt mechanism seems to be a bit more unwilling. This could turn out to be an asset. The old one could last for 40+ hours using a combination of spot and red light modes. It's ability to pivot proved immeasurable when I adorned my house with 10,000+ Christmas mini-lights. I hope to get the same performance from this unit.

20842	__label2__	1	Y	Home Entertainment	B003BWAKJA	Sylvania Portable DVD Player SDVD7027-C, 7-Inch, Swivel Screen, Black	AWFUL	We bought this for a road trip, are outside of our return window, and the VERY first time we used it, this past weekend, it skipped and restarted.  Good luck with the remote too - you have to be a yoga expert to control the thing.  The case doesn't fit it properly either, so if you hit a bump, the velcro won't hold it back and it'll flip forward.  I hate it.  I guess I'll be trying out the warranty, but guess what?  I replaced a Sylvania with this one, and that one also broke after a few months.  We follow installation instructions to the letter.  i thought this one might be different because of its decent reviews, but it was worse.  I suspect Sylvania paid for the good reviews on this item.<br /><br />EDIT:  Customer service on the warranty was awful.  AWFUL.  You have to pay to shipping and handling to return it, and $7 for them to return it to you.  And you get to speak with someone not in this country, who will make you repeat everything 150 times.  I'm not sure I'll be returning this, but I can guarantee I will not buy another Sylvania ANYTHING, nor will I buy electronics again on this web site.

I also LOVE the fact that there is a velcro cover for when I want to use the rolling part of the backpack and can tuck the shoulder straps in so they don't get dirty when I roll the backpack. I get compliments all of the time on the pink color, and I recommend buying this to all of my friends! Love it!

It is small, light, and inexpensive (they cost $200+ in Australia).<br /><br />However, I am worried about the clasp, as I have heard a few horror stories, and it needs to be double-checked. The glass does not seem particularly hardy, but that is an issue for another time.
6471	__label1__	5	N	Pet Products	B0002I0O60	Outward Hound Hide-A-Squirrel Dog Toy Plush Dog Squeaky Toy Puzzle, 4 piece, Large	Loads of Fun and Very Well Made	It truly shocks me that people with labs (and other aggressive chewing breeds) think this toy will hold up with their dogs and then write bad reviews on it when it doesn't. Come on people, you know your dogs! If you have a strong chewer, you should know a plush toy like this (or ANY plush toy for that matter!) will never hold up under all the punishment and abuse their love of chewing and tearing will dish out. This is not meant for strong chewers and rippers. No plush toy is. So please don't trash this excellent dog toy because you made a poor decision based on your dog's breed.<br /><br />The fact is, this is a GREAT toy for light to moderate chewers. It's very well made and holds up great as long as you don't have an aggressive chewer. My Pembroke Corgi adores hers and spends many happy evenings playing with it. I love that it allows us to play together since I do have to 'restuff' the log every so often. But that's a nice way to spend time with my puppy and we both enjoy how fun this toy is.<br /><br />Honestly, this is one toy you can't go wrong with as long as you know your dog and don't buy it for an aggressive chewer. There are lots of tougher toys out there just for them!
10662	__label2__	5	N	Kitchen	B00CB3KN8I	Westmark German Multipurpose Garlic Press with Olive Pitter, Nutcracker and Fish Scaler (Grey)	Simplicity, Flexibility, Quality - A Lifetime of Practical Use	[[VIDEOID:8717f46501007f1576b66bb4a3919049]]Just like my simple rubber sink plug - sometimes simple is simply the best. And this all purpose press follows suite with quality that will last a long time.    The one particular aspect I never experienced before... the olive pitter! That right there makes me very, very happy. :)    And I was wondering what the notches were for farther back on the handle.. a fish scaler! Though in truth, I'd probably use my own scaling knife, but that is a neat touch to have on hand in case one can't find the more specialized tool (which happens all to often to me).    -- I received this as a complimentary review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.

I can understand the premise and I like the premise.<br />However, I just don't believe that these bibs are comfortable for baby.<br /><br />While they are not hard, they are not soft.<br /><br />The Oxo Tot Roll Up bib has a truly soft front with a catch for whatever doesn't make it into baby's mouth.  It also has a flat velcro closure as opposed to Babybjorn's plastic snap closure.<br /><br />Babybjorn can be cleaned off easier, while Oxo would need to be washed when truly soiled.<br />But...Oxo can be rolled up for travel.

It's a good shoe for outdoors, lightweight, moderate arch support. What's annoying for me is the heel adjustment, it constantly slips after tightening. You'll find yourself constantly pulling (about 5-10 minutes of walking and they're loose) on the tab. Either the tab is too wide to hold fabric, or the fabric is too thin. There's just not enough friction and you'll be reaching down and tightening quite often.<br />I don't wear them as often as I'd like to because of this.

If your crust misture has too much butter it drips thru, the cavity is just a bit too small for my liking and they do bake a bit too dark & then deflate into flat disks.

16612	__label2__	5	Y	Kitchen	B001GS7A0S	De Buyer Kobra Slicer	Great product for the price!!!	I was looking for a quality mandolin, and unfortunately bought a real cheap one locally first.<br />Very little adjustment, and while it would function with firm items fairly well, it was worthless with soft vegetables and fruits.<br /><br />I didn't want to spend a hundred dollars or more though, and a friend finally recommended one of these from another store.<br />Found it for a bit cheaper on Amazon, and ordered it.<br /><br />This does everything it says perfectly.<br />The adjustment is VERY easy, and you can go from paper thin, to quite thick in a few seconds.<br />I have used it many times already, and have yet to find anything it won't cut properly. Works great on even softer tomatoes no matter how thin you have it set.<br /><br />After you are done, simply raise the table up to the highest point, and it becomes very hard to cut yourself by accident. You can wash it by hand this way, or even better,....toss the whole thing in the top rack of your dishwasher.<br /><br />Great product that I would highly recommend.<br />I would suggest a cutting glove if you are going to give this to an elderly person though. It is quite safe if you use the holder correctly, but it is also VERY sharp, and could really do some damage under the right circumstances.
668	__label1__	4	N	Electronics	B00CAAJDP6	Sony STR-DN1040 7.2-Channel Network A/V Receiver (Built-in Wi-fi & Bluetooth)	Comes with issues	This baby is pretty good once you get it running, but it does come with a few issues. It took a while to setup and get used to, but I can say that about a lot of products, so whatever. Still, I hate having to be patient since I have no patience.

I have decided to begin adding some Solar Power to some minor electrical applications in my household (Battery Chargers, small power tools, etc). I assumed that this product would help me do just that... In making the decision to buy this particular panel I did hours of research and then made the purchase. The panel came packaged very nicely and in great shape

8474	__label1__	5	N	Pet Products	B00TVMLQA6	BodSmith Liquid Dog Vitamins all natural blend providing the crucial nutrients dogs need for optimum health. Necessary vitamins, minerals, herbs, essential fatty acids, trace minerals, amino acids and digestive enzymes, plus Ester-C and Coenzyme Q10.	The TRUTH about BodSmith!	My lab-mix used to have a wonderful thick coat. She's somewhat allergic, so she's on a hypoallergenic food and I used to give her with Fish oil, vitamin A, E and D and 3V Skin Caps. http://amzn.to/1Dqissc<br /><br />When 3V discontinued the Skin Caps, I switched her to another brand that was recommended as an equivalent. In no time at all she started to develop dry patches on her sides which quickly went bald. I investigated the guaranteed analysis of the &#34;new&#34; skin caps and realized they didn't have the same dosage of specific vitamins that the old ones had.<br /><br />I researched BodSmith for Dogs and realized that it would easily deliver the deficiency of vitamins she was missing, and then some! She's been on them for about a month and at first I was afraid to believe it, but the hair is finally growing back! I highly recommend this product if your dog has any skin issues. It works!<br /><br />Seriously, if you love your dog get http://amzn.to/1DqiwYU
11284	__label2__	5	Y	Electronics	B000JE9LD4	Belkin 12-Outlet Pivot-Plug Power Strip Surge Protector with 8-Foot Power Cord, 4320 Joules (BP112230-08)	A versatile, one-stop power strip for most any task	I strongly recommend this surge protector for anyone looking for a multi-outlet strip that handles larger plugs/plugs with transformers at the plug-in point.<br /><br />I was looking for a power strip that could handle several plugs, some of which are so big that they would cover other neighboring outlets, all while the strip was mounted to the wall. This protector easily fit the bill. I looked at several squid-style protectors, but they usually didn't have enough outlets. Not only does this have eight rotating outlets, it has four more stationary outlets in the center for an incredible twelve outlets.<br /><br />The unit was also simple to mount to the wall. I just used a few screws that I had sitting around and some drywall anchors and had the plug mounted on the wall in minutes. I am not any sort of do-it-yourself expert.<br /><br />Finally, one of the really great—but perhaps less-noticed—features of this strip is its cord organizer. The clip on the bottom is an easy way to tuck away all of your cords and send them off in the same direction. Not only does that make it easier to, for example, use some other cord system on the bundle of plugs (like a tube or zip ties), it helps keep the cords neat even if you don't use any other cord-management tools.<br /><br />This is particularly useful if, for example, you're using this strip for an aquarium or other water-related project, because the clip helps you make a drip loop without having to add more holes to the wall, etc.<br /><br />In sum, this is a great power strip. I strongly recommend it to others.
19592	__label2__	5	Y	Video Games	B003O6E9T0	Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor - Xbox 360	Very Good Game	I absolutely love this game. More Kinect games need to be like this. Graphics are great. It is very realstic, and I don't mean hard realistic. I mean like you have complete control of everything in your VT (Verticle Tank). I see people saying they have problems with the controls but I haven't had any major problems yet. The biggest thing to remember is be calm so you dont confuse the Kinect, but that rarely happens. the only problem I have is there are a couple missions that a hard because they are made for co-op, but I like the challenge.<br />My friends were extremely iffy when they talked about it until I got it, now they have decided to get it because they instantly fell in love with it once they came over and played it.<br />I HIGHLY reccomend this game to anyone who is slightly interested in it.

2250	__label1__	2	Y	Books	0805092439	The Reapers Are the Angels: A Novel	Hard to read -	Very disappointing. The author chose not to use quotation marks which seemed weird to me, especially with so much inner dialogue. Sometime I didn't know if the main character was speaking or thinking and had to re-read in several spots.  It just seems lazy to me and I don't understand why someone would use this format. That's not why I'm giving the book 2 stars though. The author seemed to create a fairly realistic world, but then totally dropped the ball in several spots.  For instance it seemed like nearly every character spoke like a redneck. Maybe the author is implying that only the rednecks will survive... Ha ha, but I don't know. The girl, a 15 year old that can't even remember what the world was like before it all happened leads me to believe it's been at least 10 years, yet she is able to find cheese crackers on a shelf in a store. I'm pretty sure that after 10 years there would be no food on the shelf and it certainly wouldn't be eatable. She was also fortunate to find Coke in a few occasions. Never Pepsi or Dr. Pepper.  The most unrealistic thing about the book was that she was driving all over the country filling up her gas tank whenever she ran low.  I found this totally unbelievable since most gas stations would be empty after 10 hours, but here she is 10 years later.  Anyway, the story was just okay, I liked the 15 year old girl and even cheered for her. Several characters I could see clearly in my mind.  The author has talent and I enjoyed his descriptive writing style, just not the story.  I had to force myself to finish and I didn't like the ending.

They sound great. Not much more to be said about that. If they work for you and sound great, then what else is there? Some reviews have mentioned that they have a bright sound. The change I noticed when I switched them out is that my amp sounded FULLER and more DYNAMIC (to touch). These are great tubes and a great value.
12459	__label2__	4	Y	Home Entertainment	B00AWKBZOI	Sony KDL-32R400A 32-Inch 60Hz 720p LED HDTV (Black) (2013 Model)	Great secondary room TV	Just received the TV today.  Set-up is quick, but there are so many options that the experienced consumer like me can go back and tinker for a long time in all the menus.<br /><br />On the plus side: Only 2.2cents per day to operate; amazingly light(12 lb.s); slim cabinet; easy to use remote control.  It has 'Clear Voice' which is intended to emphasize speech but is helpful only in this function.<br /><br />On the negative side: It DOES work with computers but does NOT have RGB so it's useless for my PC at the moment. I could buy a PC-TV card, but am slightly surprised at this omission.  Also, compared to my Toshiba, it does not do well with 2nd rate signals.  Unless you have HDMI, you'll have an acceptable picture but nothing approaching 'hi def'.  I have it on a simple video/audio RCA connection and its picture is fine, but far from stellar...The major shortcoming on the set, and virtually all sets short of the premium large ones is sound.  A wafer thin plastic cabinet does not provide a means of resonance nor of having proper speakers. As a 2nd set for a room, it's OK; for a primary use set, you should add supplemental speakers, etc.<br /><br />The key thing to remember is no RGB computer hookup. Either you get a HDMI PC card or just use it as a simple TV...it does have USB capability though...

The 3D effects are prominently excellent, I get the chance to feel many 3D effect in contrast with other films wherein we can see the 3D moments so poorly or absolutely not. This film give the feel for me that the animals almost come out from the screen, they are looking so powerful and realistic. I think the story of this document movie is really exciting and comparable wiht other films in this topic. The sound quality is DTS-HD 5.1 master audio which guarantee an extremely super sounding whereby this soundtrack is even more better. I could order this 3D film from the UK but the postage rates were really high so I would offer for everyone to order it from the amazon.com to save a lot of money.

20757	__label2__	3	N	Home Entertainment	B004SKBILS	Philips PB9011/37 9-Inch 1080p Portable DVD Player	OK Blu-Ray/DVD players for the back seat, but a bit expensive	"The Philips PB9011 portable Blu-Ray DVD Player is a pretty good option for the back seat of a car, but it doesn't offer much more than less expensive players unless you are committed to Blu-Ray discs.  Pros:  - They generally do what they are supposed. They provide an ok movie watching experience for the back seat.  - 9"" screens are on the bigger side for portable players intended for the car.  - The carrying case fits everything perfectly and easily. No jamming stuff into place or having to figure out what should go where. It really is well done. With kids, it is important that things can easily be put away properly.  - As the name says, it plays Blu-Ray discs. In reality, the quality on this player doesn't allow Blu-Rays do much more than a DVD, but if you already have a Blu-Ray disc, you can still play it in the car with the PB9011. In the past, we had to limit ourselves to DVD's just in case we wanted to watch the movie in the car at some point. Nice!  Cons:  - You can only watch one movie at a time. The second screen is only a slave to the primary. The other (much less expensive) portable DVD players that we have can work as a pair or independently.  - The volume control is a physical dial on the side of the player, so it can't be controlled by remote and it requires a little more fidgeting than a digital volume control.  - The sound is ok but not great. It sounds much more like mono than stereo and doesn't get very loud without deteriorating.  - The screen washes out in sunlight. In the back seat of a car, it is tough to control going into and out of sunlight. These screens don't do well with that.  - The cables are quite a mess in the back of the car, but that is hard to avoid with a pair of portable screens.  - The remote control feels flimsy. We'll see how it holds up.  - The screens don't tilt on their backings like our other players do. If the angle is off for the person watching the movie, you have to play with how it is strapped to the headrest insteadof just tilting it up or down."

For the record, at this price I wouldn't take the time to make this by hand.  I have enough challenge making good circles without looking for trouble.

I've just issued myself 1 trim as such, so I can't identify with life span, however I trust these scissors last on the grounds that I truly like them. Work awesome & okay cost. I would without a doubt prescribe. I adorable my own particular hair on account of some spectacular YouTube features. Furthermore, since my hair is so thick and to get a decent layered influence, I utilized these. They worked perfectly. I have now utilized these sheers twice on myself. They are sharp. The rings in the finger openings make them ideal for my little hands. I would definitely arrange from this organization again. Even for somebody who doesn't know how to trim hair, this item is anything but difficult to use to disperse my thick hair.
502	__label1__	3	N	Books	0765342405	Ender's Shadow (The Shadow Series)	A pale sequal to Ender's game	Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.

12005	__label2__	4	N	Furniture	B003G2ZKZO	Best Selling Brighton Cloth Storage Ottoman, Off-white	A rather nice ottoman but needs to be taller to be a true 5 star item.	Dimension: 51&#34;Wx18.5&#34;Dx15.5&#34;H<br /><br />I rather like the style and colors used in the off-white version of this ottoman but the main issue that I have with it is that it is really rather short. at only 15.5&#34; high it's oddly short, granted it does work for putting shoes on and such at the foot of the bed but it really should be a good 4-5 inches taller. Then it would be a much nicer ottoman.<br /><br />-The covering fabric seems to be of nice quality and should withstand abuse.<br />-Padding on top of the ottoman is adequate but that may be an issue over time, it works okay now but I'm not sure that it will last a long time. I'll have to be sure to rotate where I sit on it when I get home or am getting ready in the morning to make sure it lasts.<br />-The legs are mounted with 2 screws to make sure they don't come loose and can't rotate, nicely done there.<br />-Interior floor, it's okay, don't think you are going to put very heavy items inside, it will not likely support them. It's good for lighter items like sheets, blankets and maybe some smaller pillows, possibly a couple moderately weighted items but don't go crazy.<br />-Lid support arms are of good quality and shouldn't catch too much on stored items but don't put things in their path as it will cause closing issues.<br /><br />When I first got this out of the shipping box I thought it was going be a 5 star item but after placing it in the location and trying it out I noticed that the height is a big issue for me. Granted I can put some blocks under it to raise it up but it would have been really nice to have the extra height in the storage area of the ottoman so that I could fit a whole bunch more items in there. Still good though, just could be a lot better.

By the way, do yourself a favor and research Propylene Glycol if you have any doubts on safety. I did and you will find out that this stuff is not a hazardous substance the other reviewer makes it out to be. Is it used as antifreeze?  Yes, only because it is used to replace Ethylene Glycol in antifreezes which IS toxic.  Ethylene Glycol can lead to kidney malfunction and even death if you ingest enough.  This product does NOT contain Ethylene Glycol.  The FDA includes Propylene Glycol on its Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) list. The World Health Organization also considers it as safe for use.
1263	__label1__	1	N	Wireless	B00CTGDSQQ	Huawei Ascend Plus H881C STHUH881CPWP Prepaid Smartphone Straight Talk	Extremely laggy and glitchy	This was my first touchscreen phone; I got it because it was a good price, but I really regret buying it. At first it was okay, but I've had it for about 9 months now, and I get extremely frustrated with it.<br /><br />The lag is HORRIBLE. If I try to call someone, it usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3-4 minutes to actually place the call. It gets really frustrating. I'll press the call button and wait a few minutes before it actually calls. A lot of the time I'll receive a call from the person while I'm trying to call them because they're tired of waiting for the call to go through. Then I'm dialing them and they're calling me at the same time, and hanging up ends both the calls and we have to start over. It's pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />The apps freeze and crash a lot - and not just downloaded apps, ALL of the apps on the phone. If I go to my contacts and try to call someone, the app freezes and says it has to close and I have to reopen it. This happens a lot with messaging, too. I'll try to click on a message and the app freezes and force closes. Also, there's a weird glitch where I open a message and try to type, and it won't let me. I have to tap on the message box over and over again, sometimes for a couple of minutes, before it finally lets me type. If I type a word, it shows that I'm trying to type it and then deletes each letter as I type it.<br /><br />The memory is pretty bad. I was going to just get an SD card and use it to store apps and stuff so I could have more on the phone, but most of the apps won't even go on the SD card and have to be stored on the phone, so there's really no point. I have barely anything on my phone (maybe 5 apps and 150-200 pictures), and the memory is full.<br /><br />Another weird glitch I've been having is when I press the unlock button, nothing happens, and I have to press it about ten times before it actually responds and lets me unlock the phone.<br /><br />Overall a really crappy phone - I do NOT recommend getting it. It looks good at first, but the lag and horrible memory make it a very bad choice. If I had the money to get a new one, I would in a heartbeat so I wouldn't have to deal with this piece of crap anymore. I want to throw it at a wall every time I try to use it.
4774	__label1__	5	N	Beauty	B00LNIW1EQ	Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit	Family photos	My family photos were being taken at Sears and I started to panic because in the last six months I started to smoke and my teeth looked wrecked. I went on Amazon and based on these reviews bought Brilliant HD. I'm glad because it saved the photo for me. I look great and my teeth look great and I have a shiny smile. I saw results pretty early and I will continue to use the product because my teeth should look this way every single day.
18744	__label2__	5	Y	Video Games	B0032ISZL8	Wii Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Arcade FightStick	Arcade action on your couch	This is the greatest controller I've ever bought.  I love [[ASIN:B002EE5SAC Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars - Nintendo Wii]], and this FightStick really makes you feel like you're in the arcade.  The joystick and buttons are Japanese-styled:  the stick is shaped like a ball instead of a bat, and the buttons are convex instead of concave.  It may differ slightly from the experience of playing one of Capcom's fighting games in the U.S., but it won't take long to adapt.<br />The controller is very sturdily constructed and a bit heavy, which counter-balances any furious special moves or other waggling you may require.  I love the design on the face, which is coated so it won't wear out from exposure to oily fingers.  And despite how responsive and powerful this FightStick is, I didn't find that it wore the battery down any faster than the classic controller, at least not enough to notice.<br />If you've got a Wii and you like fighting games (all... 2?), this is a great companion for them!
13026	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B008RB3BQO	Osprey Men's Volt 75 Backpack (2015 Model), Fern Green, One Size	Exceptional value	This is an excellent pack for the money.  The large top pocket keeps many things handy, and the belt pockets are extremely convenient.  It seems to be very well made. It fits me perfectly, although I suspect a taller man would need a  different pack.<br /><br />I read in another review that camelbaks would not fit in the H2O pocket/hydration sleeve. That wasn't true. My 2 liter camelbak fits fine, and I think there is room for a larger bladder. The straps and belt are comfortable and seem to distribute weight very well. I don't think The back is very well ventilated and I wish it had side pockets, but I think I will like this pack.<br /><br />I will update this review after field testing but I wanted people to know there is no problem with camelbaks.

No more squinting and you are not worn out from staring in the sun on a bright day. It doesn't hurt that they look good as well. Highly recommend to anyone that is out in it everyday.

It's not too big but enough to accommodate stuff good for 4-5 days, which is my usual travel length. It's very lightweight but you can see the sturdiness inside out. I've already been using this for 2 years and it's still as good as new. It's very spacy and has complete support. Very easy to wash/clean and very easy to store because of the compact design. It rolls smoothly too. It never gave me any trouble so far.

I personally was annoyed with the condition with the thought that I could have easily make this with a few items out of my garage. It's ok though. I'm not happy or upset. I personalized it by taking a gold paint pen and writing the grand kid's names on the bottom.<br /><br />The end result is the recipient loved it, which is why I gave 4 stars.<br />I would give it 3 for the condition it arrived in, but shipping is different for everyone.

Ordered it for my 8 yr old lefty ball player, who is a back up catcher. As  a lefty it's been limiting since most team gloves are for right handed throw.  This came out of the box soft, a little pounding with  a mallet and it was almost ready to use.  We took it to a local sports store to be steamed and now its really game ready.  My son is thrilled.  The leather seems much softer than the Akadema 1st baseman's glove we got him. This mitt broke in so much faster than expected.  Looking forward to seeing how he does on the field with it.

Anyways, I gave to my fiance on her birthday last weekend and she loved it so much! She says he likes the shapes of the hearts, its better that heart does not look perfect shape. She loved the way they put the diamond at the corner of the heart instead of boring right at the middle like other common necklaces. This is my fourth necklace I gave to her and she like this the most even though it not the most expensive one she got.

10998	__label2__	5	Y	Office Products	1604180900	Carson Dellosa Colors Chart (114054)	Great Colors Chart - UNBEATABLE price!!	This is a great colors chart. Really good for toddlers still learning their colors & words.  Makes it very very clear what's going on - that the word you're using is the color, not the item itself (so when I say blue & point at the blue box he's not thinking the word for a butterfly is blue; of course then I say 'blue butterfly', which makes it even clearer - but for any little ones who don't know the names of all the color examples - this is great).  We have lots of 'colors' board books (the tiny ones & one regular one) - but I really don't like the layout or presentation of the whole color concept in those.  This is so much clearer - and all in one place - so they can see all these colors next to each other & understand the idea of colors.<br /><br />The only improvement it could have is lamination - if it was laminated - well that woudl be perfect.  But for the price I paid (2.50 right now, not an add on & free amazon shipping...you can't beat that!), it definitely deserves 5 stars.

I purchased the product and used it on some pork tenderloin. It maxed out on the thickness, and some pieces were more than one half inch in thickness. The cuber took the pork through with out any problems. The meat was just the way I wanted, and I won't be purchasing cube steak from the meat department anymore.

12919	__label2__	5	Y	Kitchen	B001C0A4VM	WMF 8-Inch Flat Whisk	The right tool for the job	As a young child I always hated the patches of white in my scrambled eggs.  As with many other things I disliked, I vowed that when I grew up things would change and I would have it my way.  Along the path to maturity I discovered that if you whipped the eggs longer and more vigorously than my mother did, the white patches disappeared and the eggs became fluffy.  Further along the path I discovered physics and came to an understanding that the increased surface area of a whisk provided a mechanical advantage over my mother's tool choice which was a table fork.  One thing led to another and I acquired multiple whisks for various usage.<br /><br />Recently while stirring an individual serving sized cup of plain Greek yogurt with a spoon, I realized that life would be better with a small flat whisk.  Having experience with the WMF brand and liking the dimensions of this tool, I made the purchase.<br /><br />This whisk definitely lives up to my expectations of quality.  I always take care of my tools and I suspect this one will be with me forever.  My yogurt is now totally smooth and shiny with a fraction of the physical effort on my part.  Once again, the use of a more refined tool has distanced me from my primate ancestors.

I purchased this Air Conditioner last month as a bed room air conditioner. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is it's such a pain to have it fit correctly in the window. The instructions are unhelpful and do not explain anything. When I did get it to sit correctly, I noticed it would not even keep a small bedroom cool on only 80 degree days. I tried everything I possibly could but didn't get any sort of result I was looking for.<br /><br />After talking to friends and family, I finally found an air conditioner that works AMAZING!!! I have never slept better in my life now that the weather has been heating up this past month and can't wait to sleep in a cool room all summer long!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY air conditioner, check this one out here on Amazon -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1hsKRDg<br /><br />It's not as cheap but is well worth the extra money, as it cools quickly and efficiently. Also, it's much quieter!<br /><br />If you decide it's not the air conditioner for you, at least I got to share my story about this one!

I learned so much about that time in this book, because it is written from a unique perspective, very realistic compared to how we romanticize the 60's persona.

After being diagnosed with liver problems, I decided my house was going to be an organic one. I ordered this cereal for my kids. Unfortunately, they hated it and would not eat it. Not at all. I ended up with box after box filling my pantry. I didn't mind it. The taste wasn't as chocolatey as some of the other cereals on the market, but I would happily trade the lack of flavor for the lack of reduced processed sugars, etc. I just wish it had tasted a little better so the kids would have eaten it. If you are buying it for you, as an adult, and don't need the sweet flavor to make you happy, then this is a good brand. If, however, you are going to try to get your kids to eat this, you may be wasting your money.

11139	__label2__	5	N	Office Products	B005AT2QQC	"Mead 2"" Zipper Binder with Handle, Includes Interior and Exterior Pockets, Red (72765)"	Just plain Mead looks pretty good, even compared to Mead’s “Five Star” line	Maybe it’s just that I’ve had a lot of Mead and Mead Five Star products to review for Vine, but I’ve started ruminating on what makes the difference, quality-wise, that gets some school and office products the “Five Star” appellation and not others.  This “plain Jane” zippered binder looks to be of very similar quality to the un-killable Five Star one I have carried around for various purposes, so if there’s an “economy” angle, it’s not really that evident. And, like all zippered binders, it’s a bit pricey.<br /><br />This product’s angle is the lack of multiple specialized pockets and features that’s so common across the line.  One exterior Velcro-flapped pocket, and it’s not as big as it looks to be at first glance:  it will hold 2 pens or pencils and a few 3X5 index cards, and that’s it.  There are two nice full page sized interior pockets, though, so this will work nicely for a student with basic needs.  (Or maybe a fancy 3 ring pencil case for all the “tools”.)<br /><br />Your student may appreciate the briefcase style handle.  My kids at least are not fond of the shoulder straps on some of these all-in-ones.<br /><br />5 Star or regular, I have yet to see my kids destroy a Mead binder over the course of a year.  Tear and fray it a bit from overstuffing, yes.  But these things hold up pretty well even when they start to look like a strong gust of wind might tear them apart.  So I keep picking Mead over the no-name brands, at least where it really matters.

12708	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B004IY1AW6	How Do You Know [Blu-ray]	First -Movie for those who need to face personal challenges.  Second - Blu-ray transfer no better than DVD	"As a common audience, general appeal movie, ""How Do You Know"" comes up short.  It really isn't designed for the passive viewing audience.  For those struggling with relationship uncertainties and professional choices that require you to step outside your comfort zone, it does a little better.  I believe that's where the appeal rests with this movie.  My wife and I enjoy it because we've been through all the issues the characters face, but it is fun to watch the two main characters in the movie struggle with their own challenges.  The ending (I won't give it away) may fall flat for many, but I believe it is structured to cause you to talk about the movie after it ends about all the possible outcomes.  We've done so and always seem to come up with another future scenario.<br /><br />The quality transfer of the movie to Blu-ray is really no better than a good quality DVD transfer.  It is a 1.85:1 widescreen (non-letterbox) format.  Given the miminal difference in price between the Blu-ray and the DVD, get the Blu-ray.  If it ever becomes more than a couple bucks though, buy the DVD because you won't be sacrificing anything in the image transfer or sound department."

The range is nowhere near what they claim it is capable (up to 590 feet) of doing unless you life in a field with no walls. We live in a house and our kids are at one end, and we are at the other. It is about 120 feet from one end to the other. The monitor doesn't reach.<br /><br />The picture is nice. We like the temperature being available on the screen in each kid's room. The scan feature between rooms is nice, but you better make sure each room has similar sound coming from it, especially if you have noisemakers. You cannot see or hear both cameras at the same time.<br /><br />How the volume is not a one button fix is baffling. You have to go into the settings and change the volume. I haven't seen this in any monitors we or our friends have.<br /><br />If you have a big house with walls then know this monitor will not reach, which is a shame because I like it better than Summer models, but when it doesn't reach it is absolutely useless.

She lays down and relaxes when we have company and is able to enjoy her environment.

You just appear right where you died and can keep going. THAT is great when kids are playing this game.<br /><br />The Indiana Jones game is based on the movie and have a lot of fun scenes from the movie. Of course kids would probably not recognize them, but as the parent you do. We have all the Lego games on X-box and Nintendo and just love them.<br /><br />The game can be played over and over, because even when you have finished it, you can go back and play levels to look for secret treasure and use the new characters you have unlocked. It just don't stop, it can be played for weeks.<br /><br />My son has played the Lego games since he was about 6, and he is great at them. He learns to figure out all the little tricks and secret ways to get the bonus items. It really is a great game. We are always looking to see what their latest Lego game will be and right now we are waiting to buy Lego Super Heros!

20407	__label2__	3	Y	Video Games	B006JKASCK	32GB PlayStation Vita Memory Card	If only it was cheaper...	The price is outrageous. Sony should have made this system like the PS4; upgradeable memory that you can easily do yourself & can buy the hard drive from anywhere. Instead only they make these memory cards & they raise them to ridiculous prices.<br />The memory card itself does its job; it’s not very fast though. 3 stars is all I can muster to give to this product.
19483	__label2__	3	Y	Outdoors	B001GSKVSG	Pletscher Two-Leg Kickstand 320mm Black	The supplied bolt is too long	I'm not a bike mechanic, but I can get by on my own. Foolishly, I installed the kickstand with the supplied bolt, and I turned it too far and cracked the housing. It's just a hairline split, and I felt it give and new to stop, so the kickstand is still intact and still on my bike and works fine, but that really bummed me out. At least put a note in with the packaging warning people that it's possible to over tighten the bolt and split the cast aluminum housing.<br /><br />Other than this, this is a good product. Kind of pricy but better than no kickstand at all.

This brush is wonderful! I have used it for almost a week and I truly see a difference! It really does detangle much faster and easier than any other brush  have tried. This is my first review for anything. I will definitely purchase again.

Instead I got a ring that looked dull and cheap. I had read the reviews for this ring and am confused as to what people were looking at as not only was it dull and cheap, the size suggestions were also way off. I will be sending this back for a refund ASAP.

16344	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B000NV8940	Outward Hound Hide A Squirrel Dog Toy Plush Dog Squeaky Toy Puzzle, 4 Piece, Jumbo	Three toys in one!	Great toy for our Chihuahua! We have two Chihuahua females.  They are between 8lbs and 11lbs so they are not the tiny version.  They love to find the squirrels in the tree, play fetch with the squirrels, and fetch the tree!  This is like three toys in one, and both dogs enjoy them, but the Alpha female plays with it more.  However, we have found that buying two of a toy results in one left alone and fights over the other, go figure.<br />This toy is very well made, and we have had it appx two months and there are no rips or holes!  That is a record for our feisty girls and their chewing abilities.  I would recommend this toy as it is enjoyable for our dogs, sturdy, well made, and even fun for we dog parents who try to hide the squirrels in the tree!

It allows me to sleep well knowing that if anything were to go wrong, the Snuza would go off and alert me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- easy to clip on and turn on<br />- provides peace of mind<br /><br />Cons:<br />- false alarms until you get the hand of how to attach it so it doesn't slide off at night<br />- once the baby starts turning on to their tummy I don't see how this could used as it is too bulky to sleep on<br /><br />amazon also has the 'Snuza go!' which is cheaper but is almost the same item:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002WLGV08 B002WLGV08]]

13490	__label2__	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B004NZI4K6	BESTEK Dual 110V AC Outlets 300W Power Inverter with 3.8ft Battery Clips Cable	Works as expected.	Not much to say.  Purchased to run my CPAP machine while camping.  Ran it with no problems...  It was nice that it came with both cigarette adapter and battery clips.  I used the clips - I ran it off a loose deep cycle marine battery, then charge the battery during the day as I drove from trail to trail via some jumper cables and the lucky extra, unused, 2nd battery tray in my van.  It was cheap, so I consider it disposable.  If it lasts a year I'll be thrilled and will happily purchase another.  If it fails before then, I'll update the review.....  **UPDATE**  I noticed the review covers a number of invertors of different sizes, so I will add that the one I purchased is the BESTEK® Dual 110V AC Outlets 300W Power Inverter.

This rope lasted only slightly longer than standard 2-knot chew ropes, but it exploded into a rainbow of vacuum cleaner-clogging threads when my dog finally chewed it up. I'm not sure how it would stand up against dogs who just play fetch or something, but my dog tries to tear chew ropes apart and it didn't last very long.

17435	__label2__	4	Y	Lawn and Garden	B00CWEHJYC	Kokido Stainless Steel Compact In Ground Pool Cover Reel Set (Up to 21.1')	Better than expected	Assembly was unpleasant -  directions weren't clear, parts are not easy to discern, and the tubes required some muscle on my part to assemble. However, if you are willing to put in an hour or two, you should find that the  final product works better than imagined. I purchased along with the Swim Time 16-Feet x 32-Feet Rectangular 12-mil Solar Blanket for In Ground. My biggest fears were (1) that the tubes would collapse under the weight of the cover when it was rolled up and (2) the reel would be unstable and move around while rolling. However, neither problem has occurred (so far after one month). Only problem is that sometimes I need to pull the cover taut if I notice it starts to bunch up in the middle as I crank it up. Otherwise, it makes a world of difference covering/uncovering as compared to dealing with a cover without a reel. It's smooth enough that my wife and children can work on their own. According to the reps at the local pool store, pool water needs to be exposed to air several hours a day and this reels makes that chore a lot more tolerable.
20142	__label2__	4	Y	Shoes	B006H1XDSM	Bates Men's Talimena Motorcycle Boot,Black,10 M US	Good boots for the money	I was looking at the Harley Davidson Tyson boots when I came across these.  Best I can tell, this must by the company that makes the HD boots as they are identical in EVERY way except for the the HD logos and the price.  $180 for HD -- $110 for these.  I'll take these.

14507	__label2__	5	Y	Kitchen	B005G20IIG	Brooklyn Brew Shop Beer Making Kit, Everyday IPA	Quick Shipping and Everything Included In New Condition	This kit is perfect for anyone interested in homebrewing who may be intimidated by the more typical 5 gallon setups. The kit was delivered pretty quickly and all of the supplies were in it. The thermometer was packaged in a plastic tube and then wrapped in a piece of cardboard. It looked pretty secure even though the shipping from Amazon added an extra layer of sealed air packaging around the entire kit.<br /><br />After looking for a reasonable homebrew starter kit that included a glass fermenting jug, I was glad to find this one. Now I won't have to drink 5 gallons of awful beer if I mess up! This kit is pretty foolproof though and my first batch is fermenting as I'm posting this. I ordered Brooklyn Brew Shop's Beer Making Book along with the kit and look forward to trying some of those recipes.<br /><br />Though there were no instructions packaged with the kit, it was pretty easy to find detailed instructions online. I searched &#34;Brooklyn Brew Shop Everyday IPA Instructions&#34; and the top result was a PDF. I think there's one for the &#34;Chestnut Brown Ale&#34; kit as well.

The underlying configuration software was buggy and full of glitches.  This is a very good idea, but at this point in time, very poorly implemented.  Perhaps in a few years when the software is more mature, but at this point in time it just isn't worth the money.

5434	__label1__	5	N	Books	147675666X	We Are Not Ourselves: A Novel	Excellent!!!	I don't throw around words like brilliant very often, but this debut novel is it. I kept asking myself...how does he do it? This gentleman bravely chose to write in the first person a woman's life from childhood to older age. She experiences everything from an alcoholic mother, to a husband with early onset Alzheimer's disease. This was amazing in its depth and insight. Nothing about this book was easy material, and he wrote it with such delicacy. Sad topics like Alzheimer's can come off overwrought, but not here; he dealt with it with dignity and humanity. The most impressive thing was his ability to be so immersed in the female mind as the main character. I feel like authors spend entire careers trying to do what he accomplished in his first novel. I hope he keeps writing, because I will be a reader of his for many years to come

This spray really goes a long way and serves so many purposes for my pup! I initially ordered the Probiotics to help with my puppy's slight odor problem. I smelled the difference as soon as I sprayed it on her and it made her coat more shinier which is definitely a plus. What really makes me love this product so much is that it also took away her bad breath, so much better than the doggy treats I buy to treat her bad breath. Overall, I'm loving this spray and will continue use it  to see how much it can help my cute little pup!

There have been complaints about the strap so I'll note that but I didn't keep it so I can't speak to  that. However, if I was to get it for myself (the 46 mil size is a bit out of my comfort zone) I would change the strap, not because of what has been said. but because I saw pictures of a strap one customer had put on the watch and it just popped it.

It has a really soft feel to it! A problem I have with pads is that I have allergic reactions down there so I have to be very careful. These did not break me out and are so easy to use. I clip it on and it stays in place. When I am done I fold it up and then throw it in the wash when I am home. The reusable pads do not let it leak and come in handy. I was offered this as a promotion for my honest opinion.

The installation hardware isn't pre-drilled so you can easily drill the aluminum support bar so that you are mounting to the studs in your wall.

13376	__label2__	2	Y	Video Games	B002I0HJZO	Battlefield 3	Fantastic Gameplay wrapped in horrible lies	Battlefield 3 was my first foray into the BF/COD realm, and it was a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />I'm a fan of FPS shooters, but I've always been limited to gameplay similar to Half Life, nothing at all like Battlefield, so I was excited to get the game installed, and launched.<br /><br />Origin is an attempt at rooting out Steam as a major digital provider platform. It's not as well polished, and annoying for me to have to install. I figured that I could get used to it, as I was only going to install one game via it (which still made it pointless)<br /><br />From there, I had more issues with several necessary updates, to Origin, the browser, installing security features, being forced to manually update other security components that the programs were unable to do automatedly, and then finally get slapped with an additional massive update patch to the game. All in all, the first day was spent downloading and updating everything.<br /><br />This was also bearable, since the game had just launched. I thought it would be okay.<br /><br />I began having logging in issues. My computer screen would stay black, and I couldn't get into the game. This was disappointing, as it happened at least 3/5 times I logged into a server. While I was able to play, it was great. I was extremely involved in the game. It worked well on my computer.<br /><br />Ultimately, I would have played the game a lot better if the interface leading up to the gameplay was better. Launching from browser is a crap idea, all the levels of security are even more crap. I feel like I'm being manhandled whenever I try to log in, and I feel so distraught by the time I log in, I almost have no desire to play anymore.
12750	__label2__	4	N	Books	0374135800	Decoded: A Novel	My first experience	I was excited to be able to read a novel, the first novel, translated into English from one of the most well regarded authors noted for his Chinese espionage fiction.  I looked into the author, himself, and found that he spent 17 years in the intelligence unit of People’s Liberation Army intelligence and also worked creating military propaganda.  His credibility should be reflected in his writing and as I assume are his experiences and expertise.  However, I read that his book must past the Chinese censors and I make the leap that China's censors may be &#34;stricter&#34; than in the U.S.  I didn't consider that when I obtained the book.  It's not as much a spy book but a book about a spy.  It's dense at times which may be the writer or may be the translation.  It's certainly worth the experience of reading a work from such a highly regarded novelist from a country I really know little about.

3970	__label1__	2	N	Camera	B00VUHJO22	LuckLED Outdoor 8 LEDs Solar Powered Light, PIR Motion Sensor, 10ft Detection Range With Dusk to Dawn Dark Sensing Auto On/Off Function	Great at first, useless after day three	I was sent this and [[ASIN:B00VUHJUDK another solar powered outdoor light]] and neither one managed to last longer than three days. When I first pulled it from its packaging, I was surprised at how small it was, but I decided to follow the directions and get it set up. Then the first evening rolled around and it illuminated my entire front porch, much stronger than another outdoor light I'd been using, and the motion detection worked very well. I was amazed beyond words and I was so thrilled that first night that the next morning, I moved my previous outdoor light and put this one up instead.<br /><br />Day three rolls around and I noticed one evening when I went out that the light didn't work. (The other light died on the second day.) I thought that was odd. Then on the fourth day, I noticed that the light would come on around dusk--not unusual--and the motion detection would work as expected, but a few hours later, dead. For some strange reason, it seems the battery doesn't seem to be holding a charge, which is odd considering I live in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight here, and this is placed in location that receives direct sunlight for nearly 10+ hours a day. I even tried cleaning off the solar panel, but still no joy. So, yeah, it still works, but only for a few hours each night and by the time it's fully dark out, it's useless.<br /><br />I've since moved my previous outdoor light back and although it's not as bright as this one, it's still going strong all night through.

16946	__label2__	3	Y	Musical Instruments	B0073XHGS6	Luna FAU KOI Acoustic-Electric Guitar, Mahogany	Gift for 10 y.o.  Sounds okay... possible quality issues	I ordered the Luna Fauna Koi as a gift for my daughter, who's been taking lessons for more than a year now and is ready to step up from her 3/4 size Luna Safari Muse Mahogany travel guitar.<br /><br />Out of the box, this guitar is quite lovely.  The shining black lacquer is gorgeous, and the koi design truly stands out.  There is additional abalone inlay around the sound hole, in the lunar phases on the neck, and the Luna name on the headstock.  It's a folk-style guitar with a cutaway for higher notes, fairly small in body if you're comparing to the average dreadnaught.  I did buy this for a 10 year old girl, and liked that Luna caters to those with smaller hands.  According to the manufacturer, the top is select spruce, with mahogany sides and back.  Fretboard and bridge are mahogany, with plastic nut and saddle.  There is a preamp in the bottom, with battery installed, and a tuner in the side.  This is helpful to me, as she's already lost her clip-on tuner.<br /><br />We bought two guitars to compare, and one will go back.  The Luna has a brighter sound, very lively.  There's an unfortunate buzz when you try to play too loud, though, the strings just keep vibrating against the frets.  Because of this, its volume range is less than the other guitar, a Takamine New Yorker body style.  It does have a good feel, is comfortable to hold, and is lightweight for its size.<br /><br />I should note that there is glue visible at some of the joints.  Also be aware that this has only one strap button.  You'll either need an acoustic strap, or install another button.  Lastly, her teacher wants to adjust the truss rod, saying it's too bowed backwards.  I have a few doubts about the quality of this guitar, will it hold up for years and years?<br /><br />Overall, my initial impression is that this would be a fine guitar for a beginner or intermediate player, someone who doesn't have much of a musical ear yet.  After two weeks or tryout, I had to edit my review down to 3 stars.  It certainly has the looks to keep a young student interested, and the electric option may open another door for her down the road.  But in terms of sound, it just can't compare to the other one.  She really wants to keep the Luna, and we want the Takamine.  Mommy may just have to put her foot down.

14371	__label2__	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B00C76UUDC	Hayward RC9740WC SharkVac XL Automatic Robotic Pool Cleaner	Impressed from the start	Initial Impression:<br /><br />So far so good.  It took me about 5 minutes to unbox, make it through the instructions and get the cycle started.  The first 10 or 15 minutes it just aimlessly moved around without doing much cleaning (as its supposed to) and when I came back out not more than 15 minutes later I could see a noticeable difference where the cleaner had gone.  Its about 1.5 hours into its first cycle and I'm very happy with the results so far.<br /><br />Build quality looks good.  I opened it up to check out the filters etc, and everything seemed to be well made.<br /><br />I have a beach entry pool, and it figured it out pretty quickly and stops when it gets to approximately 2&#34; of water and turns around and heads back into the pool.  I was impressed at how it navigates the walls and steps.  Several times I thought it was going to tip upside down and it righted itself before it did.<br /><br />I'll update the review after a few weeks/months, but at this point I'm ecstatic about the purchase.  I'm in Florida and don't have a screen enclosure for my pool so as you can imagine I spent ridiculous amounts of time brushing and skimming leaves off of the floor.<br /><br />If it cut my time in half I would be happy with the purchase, but based off of what I see so far - I would be surprised if it doesn't almost eliminate the need for me to do it manually.

18991	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B0081XAXXM	Bose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones, Black	Best headphones on the market	The price tag maybe high, but u get what you paid for. After using one these for a couple of days that I borrowed from my friend, I realized why these are $49 more expensive than the QC15's.<br />First of all it is more usable in public, due to is small and sleek design. I wouldn't use a pair of QC15's while walking on the street. Comparing the sound of these two, QC15's has better clarity and surround, but the bass is a little weak. QC's may not have the clairty and surround like the QC15's, but it's an on ear headphone and has a better bass response and well balanced sound, which is perfect for myself personally. I find the rechargeable battery in the QC3's more convenient than the AAA sized batteries in the QC15's. For instance, u run out of batteries in the middle of the night, it wouldn't be very convenient to go out and get batteries, whereas u have the convenience to recharge ur QC3 batteries almost anywhere.<br />I rate the sound, design and ease of use better than the QC15's, not to say that the QC15's are bad, but if you don't mind the weaker bass and u dig the absolute crisp and clarity in a headphone and use it mostly for traveling or at home then QC15 is the way to go. And again this is my personal opinion, which may or may not be the same for everyone.<br />Well I can't thank the BOSE customer service enough. They replaced my QC3's which ran out of warranty a few months ago for free.

These shoes offered me comfort, were less strain in on the legs and back after standing and walking for 8-10 hours. No break in time and wore them straight out the box. I have been looking at these shoes for three months before I bought them. I've also tried the Merrell's and New Balance line. Found these very stiff and hard on my feet. I normally wear an 8w in all my shoes. I went up a half size in these to accommodate thick socks or if you wear two pairs of socks like I do: for extra cushioning and perspiration. The width is true to size. It will also accommodate your orthotics. I recommend these shoes if you are into walking, standing at great lengths during the day. I did Disneyland, LA, CA,  all three days in these shoes with no problems whatsoever.

They are ugly and tight and horrible. That doesn't mean I don't need one so I always look out for the best one there is. I hate the tightness of the swim cap above all. This is why I found this cap from swimculture and decided to try it out. I can't really go to the pool without a cap, because they put lots of chlorine in the waters. It's because so many people visit the pool I bet and many of them are ladies that would clog the whole place up with all the hair.<br /><br />I like this cap because it is very elastic at least. I still look just as ridiculous like all people wearing swim caps (like an alien), but at least I am more comfortable than most of them. My cap is totally smooth and sleek black, so it doesn't draw any attention. My ears and head didn't hurt at all after wearing my cap, so you can see that it is very elastic and nice to wear. If you absolutely have to wear a swim cap at least buy one that is comfortable like this one on this site.

This does not appear to be the fastest USB drive I have tried, but it works just fine for documents and pictures.<br /><br />The drive is a great novelty that has practical functionality as well!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"

I am still amazed by the perfection of the photos that it takes and I also appreciate the fact that it doesn't drain the battery very quickly. The recording mode is also top notch. I don't like the design, though.<br />the price is okay.

I could find blended candy everywhere, but not 100% maple sugar. This is the real deal.<br /><br />The burst of flavor when you bite into it is exquisite. There is the delightful rush of sweet and then the candy dissolves, luring you into taking just another leaf out of the package. I am resisting mightily, but it is a struggle to only have one a day. Is it tomorrow yet?

14255	__label2__	4	Y	Camera	B003TYA7TI	Fancierstudio 1000watt Lighting Kit Black White Muslin Backdrop and background stand kit By Fancierstudio K105BW	Great kit, bad bulbs, solid results	"For the price, this kit is a real winner. That said though, the CFLs included in this kit are epic failures. I read some reviews about the bulbs failing or catching on fire, but assumed that would be unlikely. While I didn't have any ""fiery"" experiences, I encountered a close-second when the large 105wt CFL began smoking - yes, literally - and then flickered out moments later. At that time I was more than a bit concerned and went to check the other 105wt bulb and found that the base was incredibly hot (especially for a CFL) and that it too smelled like an electrical fire. I decided to opt for safety and take that bulb out as well. I should also add that the bulbs had only been on for about 30 minutes - which brought their grand lifespan to about 2.5 hours.<br /><br />OK, enough about junky bulbs from China. The rest of the kit: The stands aren't particularly heavy duty, but definitely up to the task for what I need them for - and I think as long as they're treated relative care, you (and I) will get lots of life out of them. I just used them for a video project and the lighting was great. I didn't need to use the backdrops, but found the other stands as a great help for various gear and other clamp lights I use.<br /><br />The backdrops themselves are a bit sheer, but still decent quality considering the overall price of the kit. If you look at them as a ""free bonus"" in the kit, you won't be disappointed - but they won't compare with the better, pricier muslin you can buy. The only concern you'd need to address is lighting behind the backdrops popping through. If you can keep that in check, they will work great.<br /><br />I know it sounds silly, but I was very impressed with the bag - it's a great size, and decent quality. Everything fits right back in the bag without hours of careful planning. Tear the gear down and then stick it in the bag. Zip. Tada! So many bags are the exact size of the equipment, so unless you have a degree in space planning or zippered-duffle-bag management, you're bound to spend a fair bit of time stuffing it all back in there. Not so with this bag - plenty of space for the kit, and I was even able to toss a bag of quick clamps in there and some additional bulbs... yeah, remember those bulbs I mentioned above? Glad I thought to bring backups.<br /><br />So the final verdict? It's a great deal. The bulbs may burn your house or studio down, but if you keep a fire extinguisher handy (or just don't use them at all), you'll be quite pleased to enjoy the nice, even lighting and decent backdrop kit."

These chairs i'm definitely keeping. Comes fully assembled, light and comfortable. They do not have a back stopper so you can flip over, just make sure to shift a bit more weight towards the front to avoid this. btw out of the 3 seats, one of them seems to have a weighted bottom...not too sure if this is an updated model or if the other 2 just wasn't installed at the factory...either way...the seats are comfortable.

Fountain of youth	"My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />""So, tell me what it cant heal?"" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help."

11588	__label2__	4	N	Home Entertainment	B00ID2HJJM	Samsung UN65HU8550 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED TV (2014 Model)	Samsung Second Generation 4k UHD - Very Impressive	"This is the best picture quality of any TV I have had. It is a 4K TV and even though there isn't any 4K content yet without getting movie on a hard drive and paying out the nose. This Samsung upscales the content up and it looks pretty darn great. Noticeably sharper then others that I looked at. The sound is also very good. There are plenty of smart features and internet hookup without having any external devices like Roku, Apple TV. Upconverts any source inputted. Samsungs latest backlighting technology.<br /><br />I bought the TV for the picture quality not really for the 3D. Most of the smart features are just extra pluses.<br />It does a decent job of upscaling the HD content, but remember it is trying to upscale from HD to near 4K and the information is just not there for it to do real 4K. It, for the lack of better terms, makes a guess on what 4K should be. That withstanding it does guess well, and will offer a better picture than standard HD, just not UHD so expect that. Samsung isn't talking about what the specs are for the up scaling at the time of this review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Excellent color and sharpness. Also controls to can easily adjust the picture to any way you wish (moe color saturation, less saturation, sharpness, brightness, etc) Lots of smart features I am still learning.<br /><br />2. Excellent sound upgrade from standard HD Samsungs. For the price it should have good sound huh.<br /><br />3. Watching Lord Of The Rings On This Will Make You Cry<br /><br />4. 3D works great and comes with four sets of glasses.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Dialog box pops up telling you that you can use voice controls. This is very distracting and I don't need the a dialog box on the TV to pop up to tell me this. Its in the instructions booklet. It doesn't happen very often- but it is annoying. You can disable this but it takes some time to dig through the screens until you are there.<br /><br />2. Heavier than standard HD versions of Samsungs, like the 8000.Good info for those mounting on wall.<br /><br />3. No Content to justify early adopter purchase price.<br /><br />4. Friends watching Lord Of The Rings (Also crying picture is so good) begain plotting to take ""Precious"" from us.<br /><br />There is just nothing to watch right now and the prices of these 4K sets are going to drop at least another 500 just like when the HD sets came on the scene. Plus the 4k technology will most likely get better when they decide just how the content is going to be implemented. On the upside Samsung uses what they call a Hub or One Connect box so if content inputs get better you can just replace the hub box instead of kicking yourself that you have to get a new set.<br /><br />I tried the Netflix 4K streaming and it's a mixed bag at this stage. Some of the nature documentaries look like 4K and some look more like 1080P.<br /><br />The UHD dvd players are coming so if you have this Samsung you will be ready from day one. I think even the xbox is going to offer 4k content when connected. Does have a superior picture than non UHD tv's. Its just gonna cost ya a little more brother. I had to have it. I couldnt wait. My current tv died on me and I had to do something. The only thing I could rationalize, being addicted to great new technology, was to go into debt to feed my habit. I am so ashamed at my weakness.<br /><br />In all seriousness:<br />My suggestion is if you must have the latest 4k tech then here it is. Much better than Sony especially with their no customer service. The LG's do look good, just not this good.<br /><br />UPDATE 4-25-2014<br /><br />Ok there has been a big controversy on whether this model comes with a one connect box or not. You get a different story everywhere. Found a Samsung training representative who spent two hours educating me on every 4k tv on earth and what was what. One Connect; 2013 version of this model had the external One Connect box. 2014 version of this model has internal One Connect with no external box. When One Connect technology is updated you can get the external box and it overrides the internal to keep everything cutting edge. He said samsung is supporting One Connect for a guaranteed four years to guard against your tv becoming obsolete. I asked him about the 1080p to 4k upscaling. He said yes it does a good job at kicking up standard HD better than Sony or LG, but if you want to see something great, get a 4K bluray player, then he drug me around to show what it could do. It was very impressive. He shared a story about the 9000 which requires an external One Connect box to opperate as all the technology is in the box and the tv is basically a monitor, said stores all over the place are misplacing the boxes when they move a tv and have all these dead big screens everywhere.This TV is a keeper.<br /><br />SPECIFICATIONS:<br /><br />Glossy screen, black bezel and cabinet, silver T-Shape stand<br /><br />The Tuner receives over-the-air HDTV broadcasts (Seperate HDTV antenna required)<br /><br />QAM cable TV tuner<br /><br />RVU-compatible (for DIRECTV) -- DIRECTV subscribers with the Genie Whole-Home HD DVR can watch live broadcast and stored content on this TV without an additional receiver<br /><br />Ultra High Definition TV with 4K screen resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels)<br /><br />HEVC for compatibility with streamed 4K content from sources like Netflix®<br /><br />TV Displays 3D images when you wear Samsung's active 3D glasses (4 pairs of glasses are included)<br /><br />2D-to-3D conversion adds 3D-like depth to non-3D video sources<br /><br />LED edge backlight with Precision Black hardware-based local dimming and UHD Dimming software-based dimming for superb contrast and black levels<br /><br />Clear Motion Rate 1200 blur reduction 240Hz refresh rate plus backlight scanning<br /><br />UHD video upscaling seamlessly upconverts SD and HD content<br /><br />Internet-ready Smart TV<br /><br />Supports up to 5.1-channel audio with streaming movie services like Netflix and Vudu(tm) (audio quality depends on your connection speed)<br /><br />Built-in Wi-Fi to link to a wireless network<br /><br />Quad-core processor for seamless web browsing and app multitasking<br /><br />Quad Screen splits the TV screen into four quadrants so you can watch live TV, video clips, and the web all at once<br /><br />AllShare video and music streaming from a DLNA-compatible Windows PC<br /><br />MHL-compatible HDMI input for viewing photos/videos from a compatible smartphone on the TV's screen<br /><br />2-way screen mirroring -- send content wirelessly from device-to-TV or TV-to-device with compatible smartphones and tablets<br /><br />Built-in stereo speakers (10 watts x 2 plus 20 watts for woofers)<br /><br />Comes with two remotes: a touchpad remote with built-in microphone for voice control, plus a standard illuminated button-based IR remote"

"I jumped the gun on this 4K TV, yes, the picture is pretty, yes, its got a fancy look to it, but when it all boils down to it, its just a “higher"" definition TV that you barely notice a difference after a while, I bought mine in Best Buy and side by side you can see the difference when compared to a 1080P set, but once home and set up, its meh.<br />For the price I paid I could have bought 3 1080P LEDs TVs but had to have the new stuff first.

My is over 2 years old, I use them almost daily & 1 just broke. I especially like the smallest one. It makes getting to the bottom of jars like mayo, peanut butter, etc really easy. I like the curved one for scoping & scraping cake batter & things like that. It would be best to hand wash these, the handles tend to get fragile over time from the dishwasher. I bought a set may 2012, the small handle just broke but I really feel I got more than my money's worth. I am ordering these again. I've not had a chance to use these yet except to empty a soup can but I am impressed by them and believe they will hold up very well. The handles feel good, solid and easy to grip.

Everything was in good shape when opened. It was an xmas gift for the girlfriend. We have thoroughly enjoyed this kayak. It pumps up quick with the foot pump, stores quickly and is of super quality - to be expected from Sea Eagle. We have run aground, bumped into sticks and rocks and so far.. no punctures. It comes with patches just in case. It is very comfortable with the pro package seats. We try not to be in competition (secretly we are) when we set it up. We will arrive on a river the same time as hard shell kayakers and beat them on the river/lake every time. Then when we finish, you dry it a bit, roll it up, throw it in the back of car /SUV and away we go. Super nice if you have an apartment/small home and have no space for a kayak but really want one. This water vessel has improved my quality of life :)

I gave away the lilac brolly and decided to get another orange one.<br /><br />Sadly, this umbrella arrived and was slightly neon and is not the extremely beautiful color I originally had from my first Kyoto Flyer.  With my first, I got compliments from strangers *all the time* and in NYC...now, not so much.  Anyhow, my point is that the original orange was very lovely and I am waiting for time/usage to dull this down a bit.  It is pretty, just a bit brash.

13417	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B007RB164E	Philips O'Neill SHO2200BK/28 The Tread In-Ear Headphones - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Philips Tread Earbud	Build:<br /><br />  The Build quality is very nice. The input plug is very robust and I love the fabric chord. I haven't had any problems with the soft in-ear pieces falling off, a huge problem I've had with other earbuds. Many times on other earbuds the hard plastic shell that house the speaker components has simply fallen apart on me. I don't see that happening with the Philips Tread because the entire enclosure is coated with a single layer of thick rubber.<br /><br />Sound:<br /><br />  The bass is deep and the treble isn't tinny. Sometimes the sound can be slightly washed out, but it might just be some of the old music I listen to.  I ride the subway into school everyday and they drown out those sounds very well. It isn't quite the same effect as noise cancelling earbuds, but I am impressed.<br /><br />Comfort:<br /><br />  Packaged with the main earbuds are two other covers to a fit a variety of ear styles. I prefer the medium size. They stay in my ears when I want them to and are easily removed with a quick tug on the cord. Worth noting is the fact that the cords are very easy to untangle because of the fabric layer.<br /><br />Overall they are well worth the price just for the build quality alone. There are many earbuds with similar sound quality that I have had in my possession. However, none of these would last over  2-3 months simply because I am a clumsy person. I don't even think they would break if I hit them repeatedly with a hammer.

I can't believe I'd left the cooler broken for almost 2yrs before I realized that a replacement cooler was only a few dollars.<br /><br />Please note that if you plan on replacing a peltier in an existing device you will need some thermal paste to ensure a solid thermal connection is made between the peltier and the heat sinks. All you need is a small amount spread thinly and evenly across the surface, an old credit card works well.<br /><br />Without thermal paste my cooler was only able to get down to 65 degrees (room temp 78), but once I applied the paste the cooler is now able to maintain a steady 54 degrees.

11466	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B000JBXHZ0	Villisca: Living with a Mystery	A Compelling Documentary About America's Worst Ax-Murder	"This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.<br /><br />Villisca was a Thornton Wilder ""Our Town"" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town's railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores' doorstep one dark night.<br /><br />It's strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film's commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town's larger life.<br /><br />A number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990's and early 2000's. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.<br /><br />The killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town's primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We've been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It's also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.<br /><br />These first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. ""Villisca"" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.<br /><br />There are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels."

These are simply perfect enough for me. The material is amazing and you can tell that they are of good quality.

Sandford wasn't as masterful as usual in keeping track of all the variables that he normally juggles and keeps the readers on top of things. I never got a clear picture of who the escaped prisoners really were. Still its a John Sandford book so you know it isn't bad.
4541	__label1__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00BHHFMOY	Pure Garcinia Cambogia Extract RAW ™ 75% HCA - 1500mg per serving	Immuned	I'm a bit neurotic in general:) When it comes to by body I don't want it to get used to anything for fear that I will become immuned to effects. AT any given time I will have a minimum of 4 different hair/body products, toothpaste, vitamins, you name it. My diet and exercise regimen varies greatly by the day. I tried this and noticed that my abdomen looked and felt smaller and tighter the next morning. I loved it so I did not use the next day. I take it once or twice a week and love how it fits into my neurotic life.

This product's viewing angle is so upright so that if you want to type anything, you have to crouch to look at the screen. Many reviewers here have mentioned the same problem as I have.<br /><br />I bought mine in South Korea. The customer support is so bad there. After trying to explain what the problem was for 30 minutes, the customer care person said he will have to test one for himself and will get back to me on the same day. He never go back to me. The store where I bought does not want it back period.<br /><br />I own two other ultra thin keyboard: for Ipad 2 and iPad with Retina display. Their viewing angle is fine.<br />In conclusion, this product is badly designed and Logitech does not care.

10382	__label1__	4	N	Musical Instruments	B000PTF0E2	Samson C01UCW Studio USB Mic with Cakewalk Sonar LE (OLD MODEL)	A great, affordable mic	You really can't go wrong with the Samson C01U. It's an incredibly durable mic with a very high standard of functionality and ease of use. Definitely worth the money if you are using it for voiceovers, singing/rapping, or commutation in online games and programs such as skype. I feel this is much better for vocals as opposed to instruments, though I have much more experience with using it for vocals - so take this last sentence with a grain of salt. I haven't used the program that it comes with, Cakewalk Sonar, as I directly use the mic in programs such as Fruity Loops and Ableton where I have mixing plugins available - so I cannot vouch for how good the program is but I can say that it works great with the popular audio creation programs and it is VERY simple to set up - just plug it in and go to your settings of your workspace and active it.<br /><br />Overall, it's definitely worth it. I would give it an 8/10<br /><br />(I think there may also be this same microphone being offered by Samson with a free pop filter and some other goodies, I would suggest that if you don't need Cakewalk)

15801	__label2__	4	Y	Tools	B00009OYGQ	Stanley 47-973 8-Ounce Brass Plumb Bob	Like the item, BUT not Amazon	See my post about the &#34;SE DD312 12-piece steel wax carvers&#34; I ordered along with this item and several others. Amazon screwed up, or at least their database did, and sent the wrong address for shipping; all four items went to the wrong address. To Amazon's credit, they re-shipped the goods they had in inventory, but told me they couldn't help with the 3rd party vendor from which the carvers were coming. Seems to me that if Amazon's database screwed up the order (it was an address that I lived at THREE moves ago and which wasn't tied to my credit card) and sent the 3rd party vendor the wrong address, Amazon should make it right. I had ordered several books just a couple of months prior, and they all came to the correct address like these should have, so it wasn't a matter of me not updating my account, THAT had been done correctly. I won't recommend buying anything from Amazon until they stand up and take responsibility for THEIR error.

12520	__label2__	5	Y	Office Products	B00006IF63	Scotch Removable Double Sided Tape with Dispenser, 3/4 x 400 Inches (667)	Scotch Removable Double Sided Tape -- Works for me!	My purpose for buying this was to have a way of sticking two sheets of paper data sheets, laminated under plastic with a 3M gizmo I bought from Amazon, together back to back. No desire or intent to use this tape to stick things to a wall, to adhere heavy items together, or any other purpose about which some reviewers have (probably with good reason) complained or commented.<br /><br />When applying the tape I had a couple of instances in which it was misaligned. No problem. It came off as advertised.... and went back on, in place, holding things well.<br /><br />The tape is perfect for my intended use. Couldn't be happier.

11867	__label2__	4	Y	Home	B0097GMHXG	Seville Classics WEB162 Mobile Laptop Desk Cart	Stable cart with a solid top.	This laptop cart has a one piece level top that makes it suitable for other uses like a TV tray or small craft table.  If you need to have your laptop angled you can buy a stand to use with this cart.<br /><br />This went together with no problems other than a missing lock washer. Since the base is secured with Allen head screws and nylon insert locking nuts I didn't use the lock washers anyway.  I used a nut driver rather than the supplied wrench on the base and was careful not to go berserk tightening the hardware.  I may go back over it with thread locker if there is any loose fastener problems.<br /><br />The only possible con is the height adjusting screw may mark the tray base after repeated adjustments.<br /><br />One word of caution if using this on padded carpet, move it by pushing on the base when there is weight on the tray.  Pushing on the tray will cause the stand to rock back possibly tipping completely over.  I would imagine other carts suffer from the same problem.

15190	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B00AFQSZB0	The Thief of Bagdad [Blu-ray]	Finally Perfected (Cohen Films Edition Blu-Ray)	My review is of the Cohen Films restoration of the Thief of Bagdad (Blu-Ray).<br /><br />If you're well versed on this movie or at least becoming aware, I can't stress enough how badly you need this version in your collection. Back in 1986 or 1987 PBS aired this movie a long with a adapted score by Carl Davis. From the different versions I've seen of this film, they'll attach Nikolai Rimsky Korsakoff's &#34;Sheherazade&#34; to the movie and call it a day. Carl Davis meticulously fitted the music of the same score to the scenes and added pieces of original music himself. It makes the film take on an entirely different character that leads to one of the most moving finales that I can remember. The restoration of the film is nothing short of wonderful picture quality wise, and the Carl Davis score is as complimentary as people remember it. It's worth every penny, get it while it's available.

I cooked oatmeal soup and in my another stainless steel pot oatmeal always stick to bottom. In this one it did not stick at all.<br />Somebody complain that it is thinner pot and probably it is, but it is still thick enough and it is lighter than thicker pots, easier to carry it when it is full.

We've previously had Samsung and another Vizio sound bars (either sold or broken), but this one is so above and beyond those ones.

The bluetooth function is great and I haven't had a problem with it at all.Easy to understand guides and a high quality headphones which can be a great gift for anyone.I also tried these headphones on my Iphone and the sound quality was great there as well.Steady bluetooth connection and a great look.Definitely one of the best headphones I've ever had!There was a slight problem with charging but i hope it's fixed now.  ***UPDATE*** So after enjoying the sound quality for a couple of weeks I decided to take it on a trip... I packed it in the case it came with and after coming back home and unfolding the headsets the headpiece on the left just detached itself... Turns out this product is really flimsy so to be honest I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere... Seller tried to help but it was just a cold response with no viable solution. It was fun but it was short lived. Here are the pictures to determine what happened only after UNFOLDING this... Pathetic material

I'm one of those guys that has the fortune of a small wrist and havevto be careful about the size of the display. Otherwise it will look quite odd on my wrist. This watch sits perfectly and is thinner thannit seems in the picture. Good for me, but if you're one that enjoys a thicker display this may not fit your taste. The band is perfect for a sport watch. Very flexible with two fastens with a matetial that does not feel like it will rip.<br /><br />Thevreason for the four stars and not five is only due to the fact itvis called a sport watch, but does not have a lot of &#34;bells-n-whistles&#34; many sport watches do. I would more put this watch lower fashion watch with a sport type band. The smaller functions, day and month turners, work just fine. As for me, it fit the bill and nicely priced for this type of watch. I've always been a fan of Kennith Cole and this did not disappoint.

Not worth the $13.  It already seems worse than my 3 year old stock battery.<br /><br />If I find out something else, I'll come back and update.

I like that children's/readers' actions “write the book"" and that it's an enjoyable activity, and that it helps young kids with fine motor skills, and counting skills and with learning colors, and directions (left, right, up, down). As readers follow the directions, it will seem to them that they are creating what's on the next page.

These seem to work just fine.  I have only experienced one problem with one so far.<br /><br />I have five of these in the house.  They're all wired together.  All worked well for about three years.  Then...my wife used a humidifier in one of the bedrooms.  After the third night with the humidifier, the smoke detector alarm began sounding.  Nothing I did would make it stop.  I eventually had to unplug the smoke detector in that room so the family could get some sleep.  I ordered a replacement and installed it in that bedroom.  It works just fine. Of course, we haven't used the humidifier in that room since.  I don't know what the humidifier did to the smoke detector but it definitely caused it to malfunction permanently.  There were no chemicals in the humidifier, only distilled water.

17275	__label2__	5	Y	PC	B003UE52ME	FAVI FE01 2.4GHz Wireless USB Mini Keyboard w Mouse Touchpad, Laser Pointer - US Version (Includes Warranty) - Black (FE01-BL)	Much better than I expected	So first I should probably explain why I got it and what I expected from it.  I just built a small Media PC to run Plex on for streaming my local videos to a TV.  I just needed something that would allow me control plex, be small enough to fit on an arm rest, and be easy for non techs to understand and use as others in my house would need to use it.<br /><br />It has met those needs and more.  I use the D-pad arrangement to quickly scroll around in Plex.  Enter key starts, space will pause, S key for subtitles.  Wonderful.  The times something goes wrong and I need to quickly Ctrl-alt-delte, there is a function key for that.  The backlight is a nice feature and very useful for dark rooms, although I wish it would stay on a little longer than it does.  The touch pad is a great feature that I use to quickly get around the screen if I need to perform updates or relaunch Plex.<br /><br />I'm about 12 feet away from my TV and the computer this is plugged into and have very little issue using it like I do.  Now I will say that the few times where I am trying to type something, I will have to hit a key more than once being at this distance.  Also, when I hold it and cover the entire left side, that seems to interfere with the transmitter but not to any degree that I am bothered by it.<br /><br />For a low cost way to control my MediaPC boxes, this is absolutely what I was wanting.  I've purchased another and am looking to get a third for my next Media PC box.  If I was looking to do any amount of data entry from 12' away I would have to find a different device.  But as this does what I wanted for a very affordable price I'm happy to give it 5 stars.

This suit is well made; the colors pop, the materials are high quality and the style is indistinguishable from much more expensive brands. However, even in the largest size, it's still too small for my size 8 bottom. The neoprene has no give so it cuts off my hips, causing an unflattering bulge. The only inner tube I want at the beach is the one I float in while sipping my cocktail! I should have known better when other size 2-4 reviewers were ordering Larges. This suit is super cute and it makes me so sad to send it back, but unless you have a straighter more &#34;boyish&#34; figure or are very very fit, this may not be the suit for you.

Battery Powered With On/Off Switch	Just the right glow for our bikes	I just bought this awesome starry sets of LED lights, from this seller as a friend recommended me to do so because I had been looking for them at big stores. I did not like what the stores where offering  they looked weak to me, and very low quality. I tried some and they stopped working after a couple of days, and had a too heavy battery pack. I wanted to use them on my bike, to light the wheels, and heavy is not good for that. But these ones I bought here, besides beeing unexpensive compared to the fantastic effect they provide, they are very lightweight, (good for hanging the battery holder on the bicycle), they give just the right amount of brightness for riding on it, the copper wire can be easily adapted to the shape of the wheel, and can be stuck to it with tape easily. I am very happy with them. I contacted the seller as I want more colors, so every kid in the family and my wife can use a different color on their bike. They don't serve them now, but in the future will do. I am going to wait for this brand, as I know for sure I will get a good quality ones. Can't wait to see the other colors.

1797	__label1__	4	N	Toys	B004P95ABG	LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 7965	Awesome model, but a bit flimsy once put together	"I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I've since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star.<br /><br />It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can't. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I've read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don't see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn't seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built.<br /><br />Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff.<br /><br />This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that's mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon.<br /><br />Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke's Jedi training ball (even though it`s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets.<br /><br />The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can't help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of.<br /><br />Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic ""New Hope"" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han's absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it's seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH.<br /><br />A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It's really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can't be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought.<br /><br />Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it's still very much worth it."
9937	__label1__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B003HR8P6Y	DW DWCP3300 Snare Drum Stand	Totally recommend buying it with the right gear	I'm 100% satisfied with just about everything about it. And it fits right with my http://fave.co/1bA3TFH  I had only saw the http://fave.co/1bPOFNv in person but I thought for the price and w/ the DW brand behind it the 3500 would be &#34;beefier&#34; looking than it is. The tube diameters are the same as most entry level hi-hat stands. It looks a little diminutive. In my opinion it has a jazz or bebop kit look if that makes sense. Nonetheless seems solid enough and the overall function is really nice.  The pedal action is buttery smooth, tension adjustment is nice, really like the design of the bottom cymbal angle adjuster (no probs. w/ it backing out, all metal, and it's easy to get to), 15&#34; upper rod leaves space for tight overhead clearance and has a &#34;clean&#34; look, no problems w/ the stand staying put despite having a small foot print behind the kit and the locking clutch is a nice touch especially for &#34;harder&#34; players.

I tried not to wash it until it develops a smell. One of the reviews states that can last as long as 4 days -- in conditions where the cotton one may last 1 day; my &#34;experiment&#34; had shown somewhat 10 days (it could be because of my low hygienic culture:)).<br /><br />Some producers of merino underwear state their product has antibacterial treatment, so, don't be misled, it is a play of words: it is not that the producer gave the antibacterial treatment to the produc but -- that the merino has a natural quality of being naturally antibacterial.

1032	__label1__	1	N	Electronics	B00I9HC50O	Grace Digital GDI-BTAR512 100-Watt Digital Integrated Stereo Amplifier with Built-In AptX Bluetooth Wireless Receiver (Black)	Annoying hissing	This amplifier seemed like the perfect solution for my problem. I wanted an integrated solution to stream music from my iPhone to a pair of floor-standing speakers wirelessly. My speakers do not have wireless and I did not like having a separate wireless receiver and amplifier. Since my phone supports Bluetooth I gave this amp a try.<br /><br />It worked as long as the distance between my phone and speakers was within 20 feet before cutting out. The build quality seems a bit cheap but for the price I guess that is what you get.<br /><br />The real bummer however was the fact that there is a constant hiss in the audio. I think this hiss is generated by the amplifier itself. If I turn down the volume the hiss goes down. If I turn it up the hiss comes back. This is very annoying since I otherwise would have liked this product. Unfortunately this constant white noise is driving me crazy. I have since returned this unit and purchased a similar product from another vendor.

15899	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00IVLIC28	Hot Wheels Street Hawk Remote Control Flying Car, Standard Packaging, Orange/Blue	Fun right out of the box	From the very first day, this has been a huge hit with a 10 year, his 8 1/2 year old brother, and their dad. They all have some history with remote-controlled vehicles, so were able to get started with only a short learning curve. There have been some &#34;hard&#34; crashes, including sailing into a tree and having to get it out, but the plane is still intact and going strong. Haven't been using it long enough to run into any battery issues that have been mentioned by other reviewers, but the fun these guys are having would make the purchase of rechargeable batteries worth it. And even with the crashes, the plane (since that is what they are focusing on) has held together so far.<br /><br />I would recommend that kids this age should either have experienced adults helping them or they themselves should have some experience using these RCs. If not, there could be some disappointment at the beginning.

Bummer! I thought about buying the extra part until I checked the price for a model that had it included in the system. After that it was an easy choice to return this one and buy the S590 version for $139; even with the return fee, it was cheaper and a better model for my intended use."

15386	__label2__	2	Y	Home	B0046B7NGI	Craig Frames 1WB3BK 24 by 36-Inch Picture Frame, Smooth Wrap Finish, 1-Inch Wide, Black	Flimsy	I am not very impressed by this frame, but I guess for the price I paid, that's what I should have expected.  The cardboard backing is literally just cardboard, so it starts to bow outward in the middle of the frame after time.  The frame material is pressboard, and it is not rigid at all.  I hung this horizontally and the pull from the hanger wire caused the top and bottom sections of frame to bow outward.  I fixed it by stretching some wire between the top and bottom, but it still wasn't that straight.  I bought a metal frame and threw this in the dumpster.  It's cheap, but I still don't think it's worth the money.

11252	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B002XDR5OG	Kisses for My President	Man needs an office, especially if he has nothing to do.	"1964's KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, once a political fable, seems less so today. It's still very much a mild-mannered battle of the sexes, a vehicle that Tracy and Hepburn would've had a field day with. Leslie Harrison McCloud (Polly Bergen) - ex-judge, ambassador's daughter, senator's niece - has all the tools in the shed to carve a bright future in Washington, D.C. When a successful campaign has her elected as the U.S. President, her affable husband, Thaddeus (Fred MacMurray), sells his business so he could better serve as the White House's First Gentleman.<br /><br />Polly Bergen is very good and believable as our Commander-in-Chief. She demonstrates firm command in scenes when she's fulfilling her presidential obligations, but then loosens up in those private moments with her husband. Unfortunately, those private moments come few and far between and don't ever last very long. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, for the most part, concerns Thad McCloud's harsh acclimation to his new role. It's a comic study on the trivialization of a man.<br /><br />Did you know that Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel was modeled after Fred MacMurray? His face, anyway. In this movie, MacMurray starts out less the superhero, more the milquetoast. How out of sorts must he have been, relegated as the man behind the woman, hamstrung from voicing his political opinions? As the First Gentleman, he merits an office (dainty), two secretaries (old), and certain tasks (emasculating) expected of his post. One of these tasks becomes a send-up of Jacqueline Kennedy's famous televised White House tour.<br /><br />Another is fairly crucial to the plot. When odious dictator of a third world country, President Raphael Valdez (a cartoonish Eli Wallach), calls on the White House to demand a fiscal loan, the U.S. President's delaying tactic has her assigning her husband to escort him around D.C. I'm not saying that this is an awful idea...<br /><br />Thad is accused by an adversarial senator of incompetence, of sabotaging foreign relations, of sullying the presidential office. Good for Thad, he gets a shot at redemption at the senate hearing. But there's also tension from the matrimonial front. His wife being so preoccupied all the time, Thad has taken to spending (platonic) time with an old flame (Arlene Dahl). She's been cozying up to him, she who runs an empire of man's cologne. She extends him a business proposition that he mulls over, and you The viewer are left talking to the screen. ""You silly dupe!"" I heard you say.<br /><br />One more sub-plot, and it's an interesting one. It's to do with the McCloud children and how they start to act up. The elementary-grade son (Ronnie Dapo) starts bullying his classmates and even his teacher because he thinks his Secret Service bodyguards will back him up. The teenaged daughter (Anna Capri) and her boyfriend are all the time getting pulled over for speeding and she's been pulling the ""My mom's the President"" card to get out of tickets. The resolution is pretty mundane. That these kids act up the way they do makes for a fairly fascinating exercise in psychology. It certainly lends depth and dramatic content to the narrative.<br /><br />The timing of the theatrical premiere sucked so bad. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT bombed, and maybe it shouldn't have had. It certainly presents a plentitude of amusing moments and the two leads work well in concert. But the subject matter was a touchy thing in 1964, what with Kennedy's assassination having taken place only less than a year before. An American nation, perturbed and knackered still, probably didn't have it in it to chuckle along. It's almost as bad form as that old joke: ""So how'd you like the play, Mrs. Lincoln?"" 3.5 out of 5 stars. I took half a star off because of the very disappointing sell-out ending."

18519	__label2__	5	N	PC	B000A6PPOK	Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000	Excellent Keyboard - documentation sucks!	After reading about this keyboard in the reviews, I decided to take a chance.  I have carpel tunnel in both hands and the old flat keyboard just wasn't cutting it.  This keyboard is a dream, and with the slant is very comfortable to use.  No use repeating what the positive reviewers have said, as I agree, however I do have one major complaint.  There was nothing in the box that had instructions on how to program/use the keyboard, nothing, not even an address to go to.  I managed to find the instructions buried in Microsoft's site, but that was a very frustrating experience, and might try a novice's patience.  For such an excellent keyboard Microsoft has let us down for not providing any type of documentation in the box.  I didn't feel that knocking a star off the review was needed as this is an excellent keyboard, especially if you spend hours working on it, or if you have carpel tunnel.<br /><br />What I found on the MS site was: MouseKeyboardCenter_64bit_ENG_2.2.173.exe.  You could probably change the 64bit to 32bit if needed.  This program will let you assign tasks to the special function keys as well as explaining other functions.  From what I could find, this was it, although references were made about drivers, none of which I could find.

My cats are using most of it. The grass kit is great. My cats love it and they can't make a mess by pulling it out and getting dirt all over.  The ball track is fun. The grooming station is a fav of one of my cats but not the other. The feeding tower is a great idea for the chubby furry baby that needs to slow down on the eating of dry food. She is getting plenty of excercise lifting that paw and making the food come down. Instead of just putting her face in the bowl. It is slowing her down and she is eating less. I like these products. Each cat is different and will like different parts but in general it's great. Good prices also🐈

"I think I have bought every pillow on the market, and not a single one has helped with my tossing and turning .  I was buying a satin pillowcase to keep my hair from breaking at night, and this strange pillow popped up in my search.  It didn't look like any of the 5,000 others I've tried, so I figured, why not?  BEST DECISION EVER!!!!!  After a few nights of getting used to it, I now sleep through the night!  I never would have believed that the shape of my pillow was causing my sleeping issues, but apparently it was! As far as wrinkles go, I'm not sure.  I have the ""11"" in between the brows, I don't think the pillow can help those.  I'm sure if you had crow's feet this pillow would be helpful.  If I escape developing them after using this pillow for 10 years, I'll come back to update,and give all the credit to this pillow, lol"

Two items that were to be automatic were not executed -- Activation was to occur 3 days after a practice period (had to call on the 5th day because system was not active (live)).  And the automatic permit information was to be sent upon activation to the local police department.  3 weeks later this still has not been done which may expose me to a fine or non-response should an alarm be activated.

10653	__label2__	4	Y	Baby	B004GCJMLG	Safety 1st Magnetic Cabinet Locks, 8 Locks + 1 Key	They work great but were very difficult for me to install.	I purchased these locks to keep my 2 year old out of our cabinets. They were almost impossible to install. It must be my cabinets or something but it took forever. I had to lay inside the cabinets and move things a millimeter this way and that until they finally started locking. I also needed to fold some small pieces of paper on the underside of the front of the locks in order for them to stick out enough to catch. It took me about 2 hours to get 4 locks in place. Now that they're installed they work great. They keep the cabinets completely closed. You can't even get a finger in there. To open them you just put the magnet on the door and that's it. Simple design and they work great. They're pretty strong as well. I could probably pull pretty hard and break them but there's no way my toddler could.
7994	__label1__	5	N	Lawn and Garden	B007R18QB0	Lava Heat Italia Lava Lite Mi-5 Portable Outdoor Heater, Satin Black	This is a very nice outdoor heater	This is a very nice outdoor heater, and I use it on my patio. It's very warm so it's great for nights when it gets a little chilly, and I can just sit outside. It looks pretty good also and it's made of durable materials so it won't break!
19410	__label2__	5	N	Video Games	B007CM0K86	The Last of Us - PlayStation 3	Extraordinary!	This game is by far the best one I've ever played. It has an amazing storyline, great gameplay, a fun multiplayer, and absolutely beautiful scenery. I would fully recommend this game to anyone I know because I think it's something everyone should experience. It goes deep into the survival instincts and the inner evil of humans through an extremely heart-wrenching story. A true masterpiece.
410	__label1__	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B000JHZ2H0	Kem-Tek 099 3-Inch Chlorinating Tablets for Pool and Spa, 3-Pound	Could not be easier	Using this product could not be easier in keeping our pool clean, which is particularly important since my grandkids often come over during summer.
1904	__label1__	2	Y	Automotive	B0066QRV4K	URO Parts 914 613 541 02 Backup Light Switch	Why does this simple switch keep failing on my 95 911?	I dont know why, but these switches just dont last long. Now my backup lights dont work after replacing this just a few months ago...
11366	__label2__	1	Y	Automotive	B00AQG7VHI	Cutequeen Trading LED Car Lights Bulb Red 1157 Ba15d 5050 27-smd Stop Brake Tail Light Bulbs 12v -Red	Good for an  experiment.	I bought four of these led lights, two packs of two to see if they would work in an older car. .  Three of the bulbs fit with no problem but the forth took some forcing to the point where I thought I might break it.  They work great other than that.      Update: I got the turn signals working and found that these lights are wired incorrectly internally.  Instead of varying the intensity of the light output they go dark instead of flashing.  Another brand of light works correctly.
5507	__label1__	5	Y	Kitchen	B00UI8ICN6	Nuvita Multifunction Digital Kitchen and Food Scale with Stainless Steel Platform, Large LCD Display and Six Weighing Modes, 11lb/5kg x 1g/0.1oz	Does exactly what it's supposed to	No surprises here. It does exactly what it's supposed to do and seems accurate to within a gram or two.  this is perfect.
10589	__label2__	5	Y	Musical Instruments	B005HQO012	Fender 3/8 x 3/8 x 3-1/2 Inches Pickup Shielding Material for Electric Guitar, Rubber	Sometimes the real deal is the REAL DEAL.  This is one of those times.  You won't be sorry.	I was going to try to go to the Homeless Despot and buy weather stripping, figuring foam is foam.  But I decided that I would get just one package in case there was something I overlooked.<br /><br />I would never have guessed the correct density without an awful lot of trial and error, not to mention unnecessary disassembly and re-assembly of my bass guitar project.<br /><br />Just do it right.  Buy these.  Don't make me have to come down there.
2502	__label1__	2	N	Electronics	B00C3ZTK9M	Sound Appeal Wireless Bluetooth Weatherproof Speakers (Black, 6.50 Inch, Pair)	Signal drops out	I like that this set comes with 2 speakers. Wattage is OK. The only issue is the short range. Not what I expected from a set of wireless speakers.
17281	__label2__	3	Y	PC	B0061TVB3O	Kanex SnapX Compact 2-port One Touch Switch with Audio for Apple LED Cinema Displays 27 and 24 inch	Works, but with my Windows laptop powered up there seems to be a problem switching back to Mac	This is my first day with it.<br />I found that if have Mac Mini 2011 withYosemite and a Windows 7 laptop connected and running at same time, it has trouble switching back to Mac (display stays black).<br /><br />Dunno if would fix itself if I left it long enough, but I needed to reboot Mac Mini to get picture back.<br />However when swiping again, the same issue occurs when swapping back<br /><br />When PC is turned off, it also seems to recover the Mac display<br />So may it seems if have both on at same time, there could be some sort of conflict and may need to unplug display or power down PC laptop to recover.<br /><br />So what I plan to try next is when Mac display won't come back, unplug PC from other cable, and failing that power off PC<br /><br />I don't really blame the product, it is probably that the 2 systems are using slightly different screen modes that confused the 27&#34; Cinema display (much like HDMI switches require displays to use exact same resolution etc)

After installing the software it was simply connecting the computer to the vcr with the cable device and we were off and running !no problems! For the price paired you cannot beat it!
19574	__label2__	3	Y	Watches	B000GB0FYO	"Casio Men's AQ160W-1BV ""Ana-Digi"" Stainless Steel Watch with Black Band"	Love everything about this watch but . . .	The digital analog combo is great. There's an easily accessed timer I use frequently when I grill food. And the global time zone menu is also easy to use. That said, when daylight savings comes around, I have to go online to figure out how to move the analog dial. Which can be a pain. But I do it.<br /><br />The watch is an incredible value at about $25, and I just bought my third one. Why so many?  The plastic band gets brittle and breaks after 2 to 3 years.  Kinda disappointing, but by that time the face is fairly scratched, so I get a new one. At this price I think it's more than worth it.  Still my favorite watch.  I hope they keep making it.
1915	__label1__	4	N	Office Products	B00063NUVM	Pilot Namiki Falcon Collection Fountain Pen, Black with Gold Accents, Soft Fine Nib (60152)	For those who really love writing	If you really love writing... and I mean really! You will like this pen. It was a gift to me so I did not have to shell out the bucks for it. But it is the nicest pen I have ever owned. It writes like an amazing instrument. Not your standard BIC pen!
12994	__label2__	5	Y	Beauty	B003MJFHCC	Clean Spice 2 In 1 Conditioning Shampoo Men Shampoo by Redken, 33.8 Ounce	Clean Spice	Love the scent, largest bottle of shampoo ever! We pour it into smaller bottles for the shower. Great price for the amount.
19760	__label2__	4	N	Home	B0013O10HO	Cathy's Concepts Reception Gift Card Holder, Silver	Beautiful cardbox	I bought this for my wedding (which has yet to happen) but it's a decent size and while yes it may get a little messy b/c of the glitter it's not a huge deal. Perfect price and does the job! Nicer then I expected....
1451	__label1__	4	Y	Sports	B00K7P0E90	Resistance Exercise Bands for Fitness, Strength, Stretch, Rehabilitation, Physical Therapy	impressive quality	This purchase is good, I am quite impressed with the quality because I've tried a couple of resistance bands before which lasted for a month, these bands are tough and has very impressive quality considering the price. I recommend this brand.
2774	__label1__	2	N	Pet Products	B0002DISI6	Sherpa on Wheel Dog Carrier Bag, Large, Black	would not purchase	First time using this piece and the zipper on one of the compartments is broken. The duffle is on its way to Japan' otherwise I would certainly be returning it. Certainly would not purchase anything by this manufacturer again
12586	__label2__	4	Y	Home Improvement	B0016FZL48	SentrySafe 1100 1/2 Hour FIRE-SAFE Chest, 0.18 Cubic Feet, Dove Gray	Perfect for condo use.	I needed a place to put things I always seem to tuck somewhere else and can never find later -- passport, SSN card, birth certificate, car titles. Nothing financial or valuable like money, jewelry or stocks, etc, I just need something I can grab or find if a fire ever happens. Also put some family pics and odds and ends in it.  This chest is definitely better than the drawers and tuckaway spots I had been using.  I don't need Fort Knox, and I don't store ammo in it like another reviewer, or plan to drop it off a table, like another reviewer did.  I just slide it under the bed and know that I'm better off with this than I was before I bought it.

This is my second time buy Enther product. Those cables are great. The USB arrived super fast. Thanks. Fits my phone in the Otterbox case and works in my car adapter. Great deal.

I like this swim cap not because of the cheap price but because of the quality and the ease of use. I also like that it keeps my hair pretty much dry even after long hours of swimming. Compared with my Speedo, this I think works best for me.
16410	__label2__	4	Y	Furniture	B00CP53E42	DHP Alessa Futon Frame, Full	Good Frame	The futon frame arrived promptly and was exactly as described. The only problem was that some of the holes weren't fully punched through the metal, so when I was putting it together some of the bolts didn't fit in the holes. i was able to use a hammer and screwdriver to open the holes so it ended up being fine.
12797	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B0027HBBGQ	Pink: A Life Less Ordinary Unauthorized	Love her!	Amazing voice, good shots behind the scenes.live concert video, and interactions with rest of her troupe. I would e commend this.
6547	__label1__	5	N	Pet Products	B00HZSONNU	Automatic Water Bowl for Dogs 6.5 Gallons By Critter Concepts- Gravity Flow Waterer	Really great product!!	This is one of the best product available in the market. I bought this from my dog. Now i don't have to worry about my water staying safe and fresh for my dog. It is very easy to fresh and clean.
14362	__label2__	5	Y	Baby	B0081ZOV06	Philips AventBPA Free Soothie Pacifier, 3+ months, Green, 2 Count	The best	We were given this brand of pacifier in the hospital.  My son took to it within hours of birth, and he has refused every other brand of pacifier since.  If your baby likes a pacifier, definitely give these a try.

Really list price at $99 so not worth it.
8646	__label1__	5	Y	Baby	B00MVPO3VE	Iwotou Adjustable Multi Use Safety Strap Latches (2 Pack, blue/white)	Good quality for the price and strong adhesive, highly recommend!	Those Iwotou safety locks are terrific, I purchased a lot to keep my fridge & cabinets locked. Our little one can not open it anymore, great!!!!

Very solid and easy to mount. Allow a lot of articulation which is what I wanted. Only issue is with assembly direction- they are very clear but you can work through it. Highly recommend!
13810	__label2__	3	Y	Electronics	B00C4XVOOC	8 Element Bowtie Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna - 70 Mile Range	Great UHF antenna!  - But will not receive the lower VHF-High stations!	This well-made DB8e antenna is beautiful.  I love the plastic red caps that cover the ends of the bow ties. (It keeps them from getting bent out of shape.)  I love how this is basically TWO antennas that can be pointed in two different directions. The assembly instructions aren't the best, but I was able to figure them out. With this antenna I received 54 channels from 56.4 miles away (in one direction).  All in PERFECT condition with no dropouts or pixelation.  I was impressed, and this reception was from the inside of my attic!  Unfortunately, this antenna could not receive my favorite two channels 2-1 and 2-2, which I sadly learned are NOT in the UHF band, but are in the VFH-High band.  This antenna (as it clearly states) is a UHF antenna. If you want to receive any VHF-High channels you will need an antenna that is designed for those frequencies.  Perform an internet search for &#34;TV signals near me&#34;, and look at the FCC site and the TVFool site. Both sites are extremely helpful, and give recommendations as to the type of antenna you need and the compass-pointing information to help you aim your antenna to receive the strongest signal.  If you don't need to pick up channels 2 through 5, then this antenna will be the best antenna you ever bought!<br />I ended up replacing this antenna with a $45 model RCA ANT751 (bought from this site), and couldn't be happier. I now receive all the channels that my location can receive. (currently 56 channels total)  If you do not own a compass, there are some great compass apps for a smartphone that work great!  I am very happy to finally cut out cable tv.
20310	__label2__	5	Y	Books	B0027X63RW	Dorothy Moore's Pattern Drafting and Dressmaking	Must have book	"I am not a standard size person, so I wanted to know if it was at all possible to create my very own ""master pattern"".  Checked this book out from our University library and liked it so much I bought my own.  The instructions seem straight forward enough, but have yet to actually try them on my own."
17076	__label2__	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B00K7NCS9G	TCL 40FS4610R 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED TV (Roku TV) (2014 Model)	Simply AMAZING! Roku brain in a TV... utterly brilliant! This TV should be a no-brainer. Trust TCL. Trust Roku. Cant beat the $$	Simply AMAZING! Putting a Roku brain in a TV is the most brilliant thing EVER! Plus this is 120hz with amazing picture. PEOPLE PAY TWICE, THRICE, AS MUCH FOR TVS THAT CAN NOT HOLD CANDLE TO THIS TV. I have compared every possible aspect before buying this TV. I honestly thought that it was too good to be true, but I can not tell you how satisfied I am. Nobody believes how much I spent on it... Seriously, it makes them feel sick.<br /><br />Just research Roku's endless capability and you'll want one. A Roku could set you back $70+ but, HAVING A ROKU SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED SAVES YOU FROM: endless confusion with multiple A/V inputs, remotes, power buttons, multiple volumes, space, wires, harnesses... This TV make your life a tiny bit easier. Wires and remotes are replaced with easy to see and use tiles. Stylistically, it simplifies the pursuit of minimalism in a modern home.<br /><br />Never heard of TCL? Good, either have most other Americans, so profit from ignorance before it is too late. You may already own a TCL with a more familiar badge (and price tag) on it. I bought this TV based on specs vs price. What I got was so much more. I now recommend this TV based on Superior quality, Ease of Use and Extensive Features.<br /><br />This TV should be a no-brainer. Trust me. Trust TCL, Trust Roku.
4189	__label1__	5	N	Health & Personal Care	B00JOMBZQ8	No Tie Shoelace Locks - Lace Anchors 2.0 - Never Tie Your Shoes Again(Completes 2 pairs of shoes)	Product as described and does it's job well	Product as described and does it's job well. Satisfied with my purchase so far.  It is definitely nice not having to tie my shoelaces anymore.
19640	__label2__	3	Y	Home	B003JQJSQY	Street Revival Rainbow Leopard Twin Comforter Set, Multi	Also didn't like the fact that it doesn't include throw pillows if ...	The fabric is really thin and flimsy.  Also didn't like the fact that it doesn't include throw pillows if its in the picture.  But I did get it delivered with time to spare.
17735	__label2__	1	Y	Toys	B00IGXVB42	Disney Planes: Fire & Rescue Piston Peak Trackset	I would not recommend.	The toy looks neat, but it is hard to keep together.  I got it for my kids at Christmas.  It was used two or three times and is now in the trash.  I would not recommend.
5938	__label1__	5	Y	Home	B0081OW708	"uxcell® 150cm 60"" Soft Plastic Ruler Tailor Sewing Cloth Measure Tape"	Excellent!	It does what it's supposed to. The units of measure are accurate and line up with a tape measure made locally.

It works with dimmers, so you can tone it down for mood lighting or up for reading or to highlight a piece of art. It is a bit on the heavy side, so keep that in mind when you buy it. its estimated annual cost is a whole three bucks, and it should last even longer than a compact fluorescent.
16446	__label2__	5	Y	Kitchen	B000A6VOCW	Potatoe Swivel Peeler	best peeler ever had	I had this one before and lost it when I moved..looked long time to find it again...best peeler ever had..my hands are very crippled and thi is so comfortable on my hand.
9164	__label1__	5	N	Video Games	B00H26MUGM	PS4 PLAYSTATION 4 GM Master Mod Modded Controller (Rapid Fire) COD Ghosts, Black Ops 2 QUICKSCOPE, JITTER, DROP SHOT, AUTO AIM	Excellent mod	Works flawlessly. Better than I expected, easy to use (dpad is used to toggle the mod functions). The LEDs on the top change to tell you what mods are on and off and how to change them, very simple, and works like a charm. Well worth it and it is doing wonders for me in Battlefield.
20574	__label2__	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B007P6Y5CG	i-Link IR-210 PVR FTA Receiver HDMI Version	I link 210 HD.	The product is good, and I will recommended, but the selling company did not include a USB that others company include with this receiver. That USB is essential for the programming. If they can send it, it will be of a great help.<br /><br />Att. Fremiot Santiago.
2189	__label1__	4	N	Shoes	B004R9P73A	HOBO Vintage Daria Convertible Cross-Body Handbag,Black,one size	very cool bag	As long as you can deal with no structure, you will like this purse. It is lovely - the sequins are just right - not over the top. It is a big bag but it has no structure. If you can deal with that, you will like this bag. I like it, but I do wish it was less floppy. It is very pretty and is quite large but still, I think it is a very cool bag.
17149	__label2__	3	Y	Home Improvement	B00083LB2U	Moen 2198 Escutcheon	Did the job	As always, when ordering parts for anything, the price is ridiculous.  However, we are remodeling the bathroom and wanted to change the faucets from brass and chrome to chrome only.  A new tub faucet and the labor to change it would have been extremely costly.  Ordering the parts to change the entire look of the tub faucet was the best option.  Bought new sink faucets but, since the tub faucet had only been used maybe 40-50 times, it seemed like a good choice.  Again, only reason I am not giving it more stars is because the cost for these little pieces was outrageous.
7834	__label1__	5	N	Luggage	B003KR1K54	"Samsonite Tote-a-ton 32.5"" Duffle Luggage, Red, One Size"	Quality product	Samsonite means quality, if you ask me. Using this bag for quite a while and still looks like new. I love that I have enough space to put most of my belongings when travelling. Couldn't ask for more from a quality product.

15969	__label2__	3	Y	Grocery	B003SC0Q4C	Blue Sky Zero Calorie Stevia Soda (Jamaican Ginger Ale, 12-Ounce Cans, Pack of 24)	I don't hate it but I won't buy it again...	I purchased this in hopes of replacing gosling's ginger beer (YUM) for making my moscow mules to lower the sugar and calories I was consuming. I was happy to find a diet soda that might be able to fit the bill. I've had other jamaican ginger ale (Reed's is delicious but expensive). For the price I decided to just give it a shot. The delivery was super fast and came in perfect shape. The first flavor I taste is super gingery (which I love) but the aftertaste is a musky kind of bitter taste I can't put my finger on (maybe the stevia?) and I don't like it. I've been mixing this soda half and half with diet ginger ale from my soda stream (which is good but not gingery enough for me) for my cocktails but will have to keep searching for a diet ginger beer that can replace my high sugar favorite! :(  Please let me know if any of you have suggestions! :)
17662	__label2__	4	Y	Shoes	B002AJ4CI0	Bordello By Pleaser Women's Teeze-04 Platform Pump,Black Mini Glitter,11 M US	Runs small but I swear I can run in them!  LOVE THEM	I want to get them in every freakin color.  I ordered them originally in my size but they were too tight.  One size bigger and they were perfect.  Matched my outfit perfect.  Comfortable and I danced all night in them.
13110	__label2__	5	Y	Watches	B00AMDZ4NS	SKMEI Binary Watches	Looks expensive!	This watch is definitely a head turner. Everywhere my boyfriend goes, people stop his and ask him where he got it and how much! It looks pricey, he wears it almost daily. We recently ordered a second one in a different color and a few for the boys on our Christmas list!
16420	__label2__	2	Y	Jewelry	B0088F87SG	"Starter Master 7"" Bracelet- Removable Lobster Claw - Beads Won't Fall Off + 2"" Extension Chain"	Very disappointed !!	"The bracelet that I received (3 days before Christmas) wasnt even the one that was pictured !! It has no lobster clasp or 2"" extender !! It is a Christmas gift for my daughter...I ordered this one specifically because I dont like the type of closures on some of the other bracelets, which is the exact kind I got...very disappointed !!"
3056	__label1__	4	N	Camera	B003U2T9DY	Benro A-150EXU Digital Tripod Kit (Black)	Good product	Pretty sturdy and light weight, does most of the supporting for any size DSLR with a kit lens. If u need to use a tripod in windy conditions this is not it. But for any indoor and calm weather use its perfect. Easy to carry around too that ensures you actually use it!
9557	__label1__	5	N	Tools	B00CG6YV0Q	Longevity ForceCut 42i 40-Amp Plasma Cutter Auto-Voltage	A Great Tool That Help Me A Lot in My Shop	My longevity ForceCut 42i is one of the better investments I've made in a while. I'm not new to welding or cutting metal as I've a small workshop out of my garage, but this tool helped me to do everything almost three times as fast. I could not believe how fast I was doing all my work. I managed to speed up my whole process and began doing more work than I could ever dream of. The workload felt unchanged. The change to 220v is also a really big bonus for me. Easy to use, and very effective, I love it.
6569	__label1__	5	N	Sports	B00MRRBBCA	Jump Rope-Crossfit-Boxing-Mens-Womans-Kids-Exercise	Perfect	Needed a jump rope for my personal home gym, and this was the perfect addition, just work out in my basement once a week. Thank you.

This is  a real cast of characters and if you grew up in the 50's and 60's you'll love it unless of course, you can't laugh at funeral humor.

17580	__label2__	5	Y	Luggage	B0054IH9IE	Eagle Creek Undercover Hidden Pocket	What a terrific way to secure your money and credit cards. Worth every penny.	I just returned from 17 days in Paris. I purchased this hidden wallet just two days prior to leaving, and it arrived the afternoon before we left.<br /><br />It is fantastic. I wore blue jeans every day, and instead of putting this wallet inside my jeans, I put my belt through the loops and then put the wallet into my left, front pocket.<br /><br />The piece of mind of *not* worrying about my wallet being lifted was worth every penny. Because of the way I wore it, and because this wallet is somewhat flexible, I was able to simply pull it out, dig out any money or credit card as needed, and then stow it again -- without any problems.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

The Tissot has a slightly heavier(more-substantial) feel/weight to it. However, I'm very pleased with the finish and detail. I have small wrist (6.25&#34;) and this watch (at I think 40mm) doesn't look too big. But I wouldn't want anything larger. I was concerned that the observation back would make it sit too high off of my wrist, but that isn't the case. Overall it looks good.

The chairs were easy to assemble even though the instructions are very poor. The chairs are also clearly labeled ""for residential use"" and probably weigh less than 10 pounds each when assembled. So you know they aren't heavy duty. I suspect the bottom foot rest bars would just break in half if you would ever stand on them, or use them to hoist yourself up in the chair. These are not heavy duty chairs you would find in a bar open to the public. But they look fantastic and are quite comfortable. I really love the way they look in my bar."

I've had the watch for a few weeks and as of now it seems durable, consistent timing, and still looks awesome.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Hand-wound (I don't like replacing batteries, and hand-wound watches are more genuine and just plain look cool)<br />Durable<br />Looks luxurious<br />Good price<br />4 is &#34;IIII&#34; I thought this was a mistake at first, but it actually has some interesting history to it and I recommend googling it to learn the quick history lesson.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I'm not sure what the bottom dial is for. I use a watch for time though, so it's not really a huge deal and it's sort of my fault for not knowing.<br />Difficult to re-size. I had to bring it to walmart, and the lady slightly messed up the pins (just be careful)
20285	__label2__	1	N	Wireless	B00AIH0IAC	LifeProof FRE iPhone 5 Waterproof Case - Retail Packaging - BLACK (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Functionality sacrificed for protection	Reasons I am grossly unhappy with this product:<br /><br />1) The case interferes with the touch screen, especially when sliding to unlock, answering, and hanging up the phone.<br /><br />2) The case interferes with the microphone. I have to talk with the bottom of the phone facing my mouth in order to be heard. This makes having conversations very difficult if I am not using the speakerphone feature on my phone.<br /><br />3) The case interferes with the phones ability to adjust the display light according to the light in the room.<br /><br />4) Dust gets in the phone and interferes with viewing the screen.<br /><br />5) The headphone situation is really inconvenient (you need an adapter). Using the adapter is not only annoying, it doesn't work well. There is a lot of interference.<br /><br />These issues are caused by the case, not my phone. I thought that perhaps there was something wrong with my phone but I used a different case for one week and all the above issues disappeared. In all fairness it does seem to protect the phone though- I've dropped it several times and the phone is still working. I paid a lot of money to protect my phone, but did not know it would be at the expense of its' functionality.<br /><br />When I first purchased this product and had not yet been aware of all these issues I recommended it to a friend. That friend bought it and has since experienced similar issues. I am extremely disappointed with this product and strongly advise against purchasing it.

10905	__label2__	5	N	Books	1465420479	Dinosaur!	Fantastic Smithsonian Collaboration about Dinosaurs and Other Fantastic Natural Creatures	It's a coffee table sized book packed full of natural history with brilliant color illustrations and loads of fascinating  facts based on recent scientific discoveries.  I remember getting toy plastic dinosaurs when I was a child and they were all grey or brown with hard smooth skins.  Now some have the colors of birds (or lizards), feathers and other structures that are considered more useful for mating displays than any other purpose. Beginning with a brief exposition of the evolution of animals with backbones, the book goes from the Triassic to the Cenozoic (the rise of the first large mammals)<br /><br />Not just fascinating facts about dinosaurs, but also information about creatures that don't get a lot of attention, like Titanoboa, a gigantic South American snake that was as long as a school bus. There's also the two and half meter tall flightless bird and the Andrewsarchus.<br /><br />I've had this on book on my desk for a week now and it never fails to catch the attention of the numerous adults who wonder through.  They inevitably pick it up and I've had to rescue it a couple of times from being carried off by rapt readers.<br /><br />This one is mine, but I know a couple of dinosaur obsessed children who are going to get copies as holiday gifts.  I thoroughly recommend this book.

I've been putting them on all the furniture that we move around when we host various holidays at home.  I think I like the little cups better than the ones with nails because I've had the nails bend on me while installing, at which point you pretty much have to throw them out.  These go in straight and solid a lot easier.  Only downside is that the felt gets a bit beat up if you're sliding across the grain on older wood floors, where the boards may not necessarily be even with each other.  Still, these work great.

11716	__label2__	5	N	Books	0345529006	The Last Whisper in the Dark: A Novel (Terrier Rand)	It's lonely in the dark....	"Terrier Rand (""The Last Kind Words"") returns in Tom Piccirlli's ""The Last Whisper in the Dark.""    Yet again the troubled Terry is drawn into the crimes and passions of his professional criminal family and his own less than stellar past returns to further complicate his life.  There are as many subplots and twists as there are unique characters in this dark tale.  But Terry's primary quest is to rescue the husband of his former lover, Kimmie, from his criminal `associates.'    Like Elmore Leonard folk, Piccirilli's characters are intriguing but not people I'd wish to  encounter in real life.  Terry lives in a rough world where happy-ever-after isn't even a dream.    Piccirilli's novel works because all the elements come together harmoniously.  The dialogue is effective; the characters both unique and intriguing; the structure and plot are sound.  Now add to that an effective prose and we have a winner.    I've avoided offering a summary because, once again, this is a novel of character and of twists and turns better experienced than summarized."

It feels a little heavy on hand, crowns and pushers are all screwed down.

19546	__label2__	4	Y	Books	0793578183	SmartStart Guitar: A Fun, Easy Approach to Beginning Guitar for Kids	Excellent concept with one flaw	This book's approach to teaching music is essentially on the mark. I believe it to be crucially important for students (young & old) to begin music making doing just that - playing as much as possible first without being encumbered too much by reading lots of notation. The CD recording is very good in that it starts students playing using a G tuning thereby allowing music making to be virtually immediate. However, as matters progress to standard tuning, the recording provides notes that are 1/2 flat of concert pitch (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb instead of E, A, D, G, B, E)! Odd, especially considering that the G tuning IS at correct pitch. Publisher needs to correct this ASAP!

I love the stick welder And most, it gives capable of welding on both 110-volt and 220-volt power adapter. The foot pedal helps to control and operate the welding procedure helping in smooth welding.

The color was wonderful, and they fit true to size.  In fact even with the very high heel, they are comfortable.  Unfortunately for me, the platform was so high that I felt it took away from the very lovely shape and look of the shoe, and took away from the attractive look of the the shoes when you are wearing them.  If you like big platforms, then you will find this a very nice shoe, that will be comfortable to wear.

11823	__label2__	3	Y	Musical Instruments	B003H8MXQQ	Electric Acoustic Bass Guitar Black Solid Wood Construction With Equalizer New	inexepensive, a bit rough around the edges	Bought this to have an acoustic bass. It does have pickup with EQ which does work fairly well. The edges of the frets are a bit rough and could use some smoothing out. The intonation leaves much to be desired but what the heck does one expect for such a low price. There is quite a bit of fret buzz at certain places due to these issues. Overall it is fun to play and did not break my bank for a stand-by, casual use acoustic bass. Would never use for live performance - this simply is not a professional level instrument. But if you are looking to get your feet wet, it will be a decent starter bass. Only problem with it now is that even an inexpensive gig bag type case costs nearly as much as I paid for the bass!

When my fingers are put into the holes, they will not go past my knuckles (I am 6' tall and 200 lbs) but I got these for my wife and daughters and I am sure they will work well for them. Good thick &#34;head section&#34; and very strong &#34;ears&#34; that will do the job if necessary. Hopefully will never be needed but comforting to know they are so very strong and pointy (sharp).

I looked at many possibilities but this fit the bill because it powers with either AC, USB (with your portable computer) or 3 AAA batteries. The clip is strong, the unit is lightweight. And if I don't want to clip it to something, I can pull out two stablizer bars and set it on a table top. While the light color may not be perfect for painting it is remarkably good, as is the brightness level, and allow me to see my palette or painting colors more accurately.  I have had it for over a month with no problem.

Moving furniture around the house has just become a whole lot easier.<br /><br />I first purchased five cards that come with 4 sliders each and after my initial experience have made a second purchase for 10 additional cards.<br /><br />Installing was easy - less than 60 seconds. I spent more time cleaning the floor first and laying protective fabric on the floor to have the furniture lay on its back then prepare the base of the legs for ascetic appeal.

Disappointed & due not want to spend more on shipping back so will try give to family or friends that can tolerate retinal w/out redness inflammation when waking up. When wanting only Garnier Nuritioniste Pro instead of the intentive can be pretty tricky due to they both boxes almost look the same unless you know what your buying or put them next to each other then you will notice the difference.

4498	__label1__	5	N	Books	1594480931	The Better Brain Book: The Best Tool for Improving Memory and Sharpness and Preventing Aging of the Brain	Better Brain, Better Me!	I read this book 2 1/2 years ago, loved it then, still love it now!  I don't remember how much detail the author gave on nootropics but it was after reading this book I began my quest to sharpen my mind and improve my overall cognitive functioning.  This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.<br /><br />Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.<br /><br />They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, [[ASIN:B009K30D28 Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets]].  They're inexpensive and effective, plain and simple.<br /><br />And of course if you haven't already, read this book which, for me, was my personal inspiration and the beginning of my journey to a better me; [[ASIN:1594480931 The Better Brain Book]].

I was concerned it might not fit in which case I would simply return it, but it fits like a glove all the way to the ground. The material is very thick and feels like quality stuff. I think its worth the extra money to buy a nice cover like these to protect my investment in a patio set the best I can. Very pleased and will be purchasing more Ravenna series covers from Classic Accessories.<br /><br />Also, the packaging was minimal which I can really appreciate.

Today, I assembled this chest in a customers house and had never assembled this piece before. I read many of the reviews on this chest and I don't quite understand all the negative reviews. I assemble many different brands similar to this chest and they are all virtually the same in that they are made with medium to high density particle board. Most very expensive furniture you buy already assembled, are also made from particle board but you might not realize it because it's already assembled for you. For the money, this chest is as good as most of them. The metal cams used for assembly are used in almost 100% of other furniture like this. It went together easy enough and looked exactly like the picture when finished. I would rate it very good for the low price and free delivery.

It is hard to tell what the red part is made of, but it appears to be a very hard plastic coating over metal. I tried scraping and tugging at it with a pair of pliers and all it left was a small scrape, that didn't hurt it at all.<br />It's turly expensive.

17276	__label2__	3	Y	Books	1476727651	Doctor Sleep: A Novel	Three Stars is Good	"The good news is that this was a book I couldn't put down, even after the hand cramps started from holding the Kindle for so long.  The bad news is if you want to read a book that will scare the actual sleep from you, you're best off reading Neil Gaiman's ""The Ocean at the End of the Lane.""<br /><br />""Doctor Sleep"" is not a bad book.  It's actually one of King's better books, but ranks below his most recent works ""Joyland"" and ""11/22/63.""<br /><br />The books fails in an area that you would not expect from King.  It's not long enough.  The most interesting part of the book is the beginning.  The scariest part of the book is the beginning.  Danny's early days following what happened at the Overlook are far more interesting than anything else and the least developed.  How does one survive something as horrifying as what happened to the young Danny?<br /><br />It was King himself, I believe, who once said that a book is only as good as its villain.  And while the concept of psychic vampires is interesting, the characters themselves are rather weak and hamstrung quite easily.<br /><br />How was the True Knot formed?  Who are these people?  Who was Rose?  How did she come to be?  Where is her origin story?  We are treated in the beginning to the origin story of one the members and then that character is barely seen for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Again, this was not a bad book.  If it were not by King, I might have rated it higher, but I've come to expect more from him.  In the end he didn't let down Danny completely, but he could have done better by him."

I like that they are removable. Even after pulling it off one thing and re-sticking it to another, it worked well and adhered. I used a cheapy chalkboard marker and it looked fine. I think a better quality one would have given it a more &#34;chalkboard look&#34;. The thing is, these are PVC... so you do get that sense that they are more plastic like labels, than matte chalkboard. But nonetheless - they are labels and they do what they are supposed to do.

8894	__label1__	5	N	Automotive	B000H6P55W	Keeper 07203 Waterproof Roof Top Cargo Bag (15 Cubic Feet)	It's no wonder this product is #1	I used this on a road trip from Maryland to Georgia and back. It went through rain, frost, and sun- worked like a dream! It is much larger than expected, which was great, we were able to pack luggage for 2 high maintenance women, 1 man and a baby entirely on top of the vehicle in this cargo bag on top of my Volkswagen Touareg. The babys bouncer was broken down and able to fit in the cargo bag as well. It allowed us to fit our dog in the vehicle and bring him on the trip- he wouldn't have fit otherwise!<br /><br />The bag did leak a little rain on the way down, but that was our fault for not securely fastening the velcro. On the way back, it did not allow any water to enter the bag. The best part (aside from the price- WOW!! What a deal!!) is that we were able to remove the bag from the top of the vehicle after the trip, fold it up and store it in the shed. A hard rooftop carrier would definitely not be as convenient.<br /><br />We used 2 Master Lock straps and the top of vehicle mat (to prevent paint scratches)- both purchased on Amazon in addition to the VW crossbars (from the dealership) to make this work. I could see it working without the crossbars with just the straps and vehicle mat- the bag and the 2 other items combined are less than $70. AWESOME.<br /><br />I am typically very conscious about the look of my vehicle, and from seeing photos online was still wary of the aesthetics. Once we secured the bag to the top of the vehicle, when full of our luggage, I will say it did not look bad at all.<br /><br />Overall- this bag deserves 5 stars for aesthetics, price, ease of use, size and storage capability!

Thats where it went!<br /><br />As plain chips I would give it a 10. But as the Barbecue Chips I used to have I would rate it a 5.<br /><br />Do you remember that scene in Casino where he tells the baker to get equal amounts of blueberries in each muffin.....I think Better Made should have that policy.

A few days after that started, the entire unit went dead.<br /><br />Out of the box it looked like a return, even had essential oil smell in the container.  I could not return it because I didn't unbox it and use it until after I moved--- too much time had passed.

The seller claims the pieces are ""solid"" and ""filled"", but no - they're each hollow, flimsy and embarrassing. You can blow them over easier than blowing out a birthday candle! The weight of the pieces is about 14 ounces so each piece must be about 1/4 of an ounce. A shabby production all around, as hollow as the claim that these chessmen are in any way standard. By ""value"" I suppose the this means cheesy. Even the board is nasty and smells funny, but we were able to salvage it after we aired it out for a few weeks. Unfortunately you won't be able to do anything about the cheap hollowed out pieces."

I have to say I couldn't have chosen better!  It looks so much better in person than in the photo!  It looks contemporary yet classy.  It is very  sturdy - absolutely no wobbling - and as another reviewer said the legs are real wood, not veneer.  I was a little worried that the espresso color would be too dark, but it's quite lovely and has some vague red tones, almost like a mahogany - even came with a touch-up pen.  I could not be more pleased, especially for only $155!  I highly recommend this product.

12447	__label2__	5	N	Home	B00X7R1FZ2	Shark Rotator Powered Lift-Away TruePet (NV752)	Using is Believing!	This is my second Shark after a long line of Orecks and Hoovers.  Due to having two cats and asthma (I know my pulmonary MD gives me heck about the cats too) I have to stay on top of the cat fur in my environment.  The Orecks were a step up from the Hoovers in the cat fur pick up, but even with their Hepa Filter I coughed my head off vacuuming and changing the bag.  Enter my first Shark approximately three years ago.  It was as if I entered a new orbit.  I love not having a bag to change and emptying the collection chamber was a snap.  This newest Shark has the same terrific pickup, I may say even better.  The same swivel head makes cornering a breeze.   I think the light on this model is even more brighter than my previous model.   You can easily clean under beds, low furniture and kitchen cabinets.   Dust bunnies and fur balls can no longer hide.  Getting close to baseboards are tricky no longer.  The cat fur on the furniture doesn't have a chance especially with the True Pet portion of this vacuum.  I could not believe that Shark could make a better vacuum cleaner than my original but they have successfully  reinvented the wheel.  This one is a monster!!  My carpets and wood flooring looks new.  I could wax on about this Shark all day but just give it a try!  Using is believing!!

I was so excited when I purchased this chair but was let down pretty fast when I opened the box. The seat was fine…..could be better quality material but I was willing to overlook that. The main thing that got me mad was that 1 of the legs was broken already! After I was given a replacement set of legs……they broke after about 3 weeks!!! I would strongly advise against this product.

Wish I hadn't waited so long, but i did. Unfortunately, they didnt fit at all. I called them and they said I had ordered the correct ones, but i am stuck with them as they only offer a 30 return policy. Even though they were in the box the whole time. So i am now stuck with something that doesnt come close to fitting and out over $100.

11543	__label2__	5	Y	Electronics	B008D6YZXG	Fosmon HD1832 Intelligent 5x1 5-Port HDMI Switch/Switcher with IR Remote and AC Adapter Supports 3D	Good value 5 port HDMI Swtcher. Includes the power supply.	The Fosmon HD1832 Intelligent 5x1 5-Port HDMI Switcher is identical to a number of other no-brand generic HDMI switchers being offered on Amazon, with the important difference that it seems to be better finished and, most importantly, it includes a power supply adapter. There are a couple of other no-name switchers, that are otherwise identical, being sold without the power adapter. Obviously, having the power adapter is a plus. The unit is easy to set up and install, has the advantage of having the HDMI output on the opposite side as three of the HDMI inputs, and it has an IR remote sensor and a remote. I would worry more about the remote failing than the switch itself. So I would suggest making sure that you enter the remote commands in a learning remote if you have one, and use that remote instead of the supplied remote. In a pinch it has manual switching on the unit also. All easy to setup and has worked just fine for all kinds of HDMI devices plugged into it for display on my TV. RECOMMENDED.

11439	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00BQYQYHC	Fisher-Price Roll N Go Get Away Garage	Best gift this year for our almost 3yo (he's able to use it all by himself too!)	This was a christmas gift for our almost 3yo son from his aunt - He LOVED it - all present opening stopped for about 30 minutes since he simply could not wait for us to get this out of the box so he could play with it - we had to let him play with ½ of it b/c he was so excited!!  It was hands down the best gift this year.  It did take his dad a few minutes to assemble (like 10 minutes maybe) - but once put together it's worked almost flawlessly - my son LOVES using the elevator (& closing the gate every time) - then taking the car over with the crane - & he was able to use all of this entirely on his own after the first time we showed him.<br /><br />The only thing about this that could be designed a bit better would be the police car ramp (at the top of the elevator there's a ramp that holds a car - it's designed so when the car in the elevator is released onto the top level that ramp releases the car it's holding - so you end up with the police car chasing the yellow car).  It's a bit of a pain to load - I have to use both hands to keep the release in place (since otherwise the ramp doesn't stay up) - or I have to hold it up while my son puts it in.  This is the only bit he struggle to do on his own (he gets lucky every once in a while though).<br /><br />The pull out extension of the road on the bottom level is kinda weird - not sure why it's even necessary & can be a bit uncooperative at times when it comes to getting it back in - but it's not like that has any effect on the overall functionality of this product.  I will admit - I am concerned about how long the crane will last - the spring is quite strong - so when my son pulls it over to the other level it snaps back quite quickly.  Not concerned about it hurting my son - but am concerned that it will eventually crack the molded plastic or something....we'll see.<br /><br />But overall we're totally thrilled with this toy - as is my son.  Even we've had fun playing with this thing...it's great.  I imagine there may be some people who get some duds - whenever you involve mass production of molded plastic & a lot of little moving parts, that happens - but fisher price has always been pretty good at providing replacements for us when this has happened (can't speak to this specific product - but if you have trouble with yours I suggest just contacting fisher price - they'll probably send you a new one).  Definitely recommend this for any toddler who loves cars.

Very nice headphones, was looking for something to use around the house so cord wouldn't get tangled and I could listen to music while I was doing work around the house. These work perfectly for that.The only issue is : The voice quality for answering phone calls is not outstanding. In fact, the quality seems barley adequate. Thankfully I use this headset mostly for podcast and for streamed TV and movies so I am very happy so far. Battery life is good I.

I had somebody to help me, and I would recommend having someone to help you.  The chair is very comfortable and feels sturdy.  It's also easy to adjust the height on the chair.  The only thing I have a gripe with is that the chair pops occasionally, but what chair doesn't?  Overall, this is a great chair, especially for the money.

This is the first time I've used Missing Link for Skin and Coat.  It takes at least 3 weeks to begin to see the benefits but my Irish Setters' skin is much less itchy than before.  I had used medicine to stop the Irish boy's itching but that didn't seem to have lasting results but the Skin and Coat has improved both of Irish ""kids'"" skin.  The flakiness is improving as well.  This is not an overnight cure but if given at least three weeks, this product will improve a dog's skin and coat."
19224	__label2__	5	Y	Camera	B0039BPG1A	Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black)	Solid construction and an excellent value	I just received this today for my Fujifilm Finepix S4200, which fits in perfectly with room on top for the camera's neck strap. There is extra room inside the compartment (a small padded non-removable insert), where I stowed the data/video cable with ease. (I suppose this section could also be used to hold virtually any smartphone.) The padding in the compartment provides a decent amount of protection, though just like any sensitive equipment case I would still refrain from dropping it on the ground.<br /><br />There is a nice little compartment on the inside lid which uses a loop of elastic to cover the metal zipper (most likely to prevent it from dangling down on the camera while closed), which is a nice place to store extra memory cards and a screen wipe. The two side compartments are complementary, which I will probably use for extra batteries (since the S4200 uses AAs). The detachable shoulder strap is very good quality and will handle a bit of abuse.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase, considering the prices of other cases out there as well as the reputation Case Logic is known for. If you aren't looking for an elaborate case and like sturdy construction, this is an excellent choice.

The numbers on the pivot points really help with remembering alternate configurations.  The fans are a bit noisy at times but nothing terrible. The side platform is nice to have but I decided not to use it just yet. The 2 plastic clamps go along the bottom edge and help hold your laptop in place when tilting the table at extreme angles.  It's lightweight but feels durable. Should have got this long ago.

I could definitely hear the lows and the highs and more importantly the bass. I selected this model in color black with the red dots.<br />The speaker did not take long to charge on the initial charge. I paired my iPhone with my new speaker and played a few songs from my device. I then listened to some music from Sirius and Pandora. I was definitely hearing vibrant and lifelike music.<br />I initially liked the &#34;voice&#34; that helps with the pairing of the devices. I can see how it might get annoying after awhile, but I didn't find how to turn it off anywhere in the user manual.<br />While connected to my iPhone, I can adjust the volume from my device or from the speaker.<br />I'm very happy with my purchase. Money well spent. I do highly recommend this speaker.

They are push connectors and not screw on.  Second the customer support people do not know the product.<br /><br />You cannot skip zones when you have the all zone remote programmed.  In other words you cannot say do all zones skipping the empty ones.  That means that the pump has to run.  I guess if you had a system that did not need a pump you would just time through the zone with no connection and everything would be ok.<br /><br />I am tearing out the system and putting a rain bird system in that has a better range to the remote.  I am on 1 acre property and the unit does not reach 300 feet.<br /><br />Consider purchasing quality and you will not have the headaches I have had.

It is a little heavy to lift initially but I carry it on my shoulder with the bag leaning on my back and it's a breeze.

This really was the answer. We had enough room in the larger bag for a very long weekend trip for the two of us.

I bought two of them since I want to give one as a gift to my daughter and son-in-law and will probably order some more. They are wonderful gifts for people who have cars and I am sure everyone will appreciate such a mitt since it is very helpful in many different ways.
11431	__label2__	5	Y	Watches	B004FPMOVY	Nemesis Men's SSN910K Punk Rock Collection Black Snake Skull Watch with Leather Band	Very Happy with the Quality and the Look - Great Deal	I purchased this for my ex-husband for Father's Day as a gift from our three children. He has always loved dragon designs and he has been needing a watch. The design was definitely something he would like so even though I was not at all familiar with the brand, I went ahead and purchased the watch hoping the quality would be acceptable. The watch arrived yesterday and I was very happy with the purchase. The watch has a quality, heavy feel to it but not so heavy that wearing it would be uncomfortable. The band isn't so wide that it looks immature, making it suitable for a grown man. In fact, the band was thinner than I thought it would be and gives a fashionable, refined look to it. I have to say it is a very nice looking watch. It is also unique, which is a plus. A great watch for someone who does not like to wear the same old same old when it comes to accessories. I will definitely look into other designs by this brand for future gift purchases.
17959	__label2__	2	Y	Electronics	B0036VO81C	C2G / Cables To Go Audio Unlimited 900MHz Wireless Shower Speaker with Dual Power Transmitter, White (SPK-SHOWER2)	Worked great for a couple months then.....	My husband likes to listen to his iPod in the shower so this was a great product for him to do just that without blasting out the rest of the family.  However, after a couple months the quality of the sound was poor.  It seems to be in the wire of the dock but good luck trying to figure out how to fix that.  Too bad it is past our return date.  We really liked it while it worked so he is already looking for a different one but would like the dock to be direct instead of a wire.

16602	__label2__	3	Y	Grocery	B00B0ZMNOU	Solofill V1 GOLD CUP 24K Plated Refillable Filter Cup for Coffee Pod	Great item with a couple flaws.	I love this item! It's great being able to use my own choice in my Vue machine when I want.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant at first considering a friend of mine had tried similar items for his Platinum Keurig brewer and said the coffee always seemed weak. Thankfully that is not the case here (there is always the strong option on the Vue brewer if you need it even stronger).<br /><br />As of writing this review I believe this is the only product out there that fulfills this function for the Vue brewer. Luckily this item is quality built and designed very well. Their customer service responds quickly and was very helpful regarding my inquiries. The piano hinge is very strong and the plastic the cup is made of is thick, so I believe it will last a long time. The cup and filter are easy to clean, although at a while the file does start to darken with coffee oils, although they informed me that this can be easily taken care of with distilled white vinegar and a soft toothbrush. The decaflow head does distribute water evenly. This item also works well with loose leaf tea and I have used tea bags with great success as well.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that you must make sure the lid is compressed as possible, and must be careful when closing and opening the Vue machine. The cup can and will slide, which if not careful when will damage the needle due to the cup sliding out into the needles path. I'm not sure if they could have designed a solution to this problem due the design of the machine's horizontal brewing style.<br /><br />UPDATE July 9th, 2013: After attempting to clean off some of the coffee that stains/builds up on the gold screen after a while following the instructions I received after making an inquiry (see review above) some of the gold plating has come off. I was extremely gentle with the soft toothbrush after letting it soak in distilled white vinegar overnight. I even tried using the pads of my fingers very lightly which yielded in the sameresult unfortunately.<br /><br />I still believe this product is worth purchasing if you want to use your own coffee with the Vue machine as it fulfills its function very well....Just be aware of the couple downsides with this product as well.

Bagels have to be toasted on max and again set to about the 3 setting for my liking.  White toast is set 7 clicks back from max.  It was not much better than my $9.99 toaster it replaced.
15268	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B008AWDCDW	SOL REPUBLIC 1102-61 AMPS In-Ear Headphones with 1-Button Remote and Microphone - Black	I was a pretty committed SkullCandy user	I didn't buy these headphones from Amazon but I got it new from our campus bookstore.  Before I started using the SOL AMPS, I was a pretty committed SkullCandy user.  Specifically I had the SkullCandy Ink'd 2 and Smokin' Buds 2.  I honestly didn't have any problem with these except for the occasional times when they will fall apart.  I got the SOL AMPS for fun and I'm really glad I picked them out and this is why...<br /><br />DESIGN<br />I wanted something different from SkullCandy and I thought the style of these looked fun and unique.  The SOL logo on the side definitely looks attractive.  I also like how the buds are angled so you can get a better fit.  I was a little worried about the outer part being abnormally large and odd when they are in my ears, but it doesn't really bother me, and in fact it feels very comfortable...<br /><br />COMFORT<br />These are one of the best fitting ear headphones I've ever tried.  They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget I have them in my ears when the music isn't playing.  While the SkullCandy buds fits me fairly well, they don't fit other people when they ask to borrow my SkullCandy headphones.  However, the fitting of the SOL AMPS is perfect.  It feels very snug.  I have exercised (ex. running on treadmill, weightlifting, biking, etc.) using both SkullCandy and SOL AMPS and the SOL AMPS are superior by far.  I never feel like they are going to fall out no matter how much I sweat or move.  These headphones are definitely a plus in comfort.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br />The switch from SkullCandy to SOL AMPS is phenomenal.  I feel like I can hear a crisp sound compared to SkullCandy.  I love SkullCandy and thought it was great but wow these definitely give an additional boost to the bass.  The bass isn't overwhelming and it sounds just right.  I'm a person who listens a WIDE range of music (ex. Electronic, Rap, Country, to Classical) and the quality doesn't sound lost in all of the genres.<br /><br />MIC and VOLUME<br />I've used this for calls and skype and I never have problems talking or hearing people.  I sometimes have to hold the mic portion close to my mouth to make myself clearer but this isn't really a problem for me.  This is definitely a nice feature.<br /><br />Having the controls for the volume is so wonderful.  It definitely eliminates the hassle of taking taking out your phone (I have an iPhone) to adjust the volume or even shuffling music.  I use these buttons (almost as an abuse) because that's how convenient they are.  When I am using the SOL AMPS on the bus or any public areas, I never hear any background noises and in addition I can have the volume high without bothering the person who is next to me.<br /><br />PRICE<br />I bought these for a little more than what it is selling on Amazon.  I think these headphones are definitely worth the price!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a treat to an enjoyable experience.  Good job Sol Republic!

18981	__label2__	3	Y	Office Products	B00CSIOKQ2	Atlantic Mission Desk with Drawer	Nice looking, but defective	The style, color, and size of this desk are just what I was looking for. However, one of the side slats was scratched. The customer service rep that I called was very helpful, but the company was not able to replace just the damaged part. Instead, I was offered a complete new desk and did not need to return the defective one. The replacement desk arrived within a few days. However, it was also defective as the screws that were predrilled into one of the legs were crooked, making it impossible to assemble. Fortunately, I was able to use parts from both of the desks to assemble one. The quality of workmanship is not as it should be considering the price of this desk. Overall, it is really a very lovely looking piece of furniture.

I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy!

15039	__label2__	4	Y	Baby	B00318CLTQ	THERMOS FOOGO 11-Ounce Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple	Almost perfect, but still functional	This clear attractive kids travel cup has oz markings which is nice. This lost 1 star of performance for me because the length of the straw isn't long enough to drink past the 2 oz mark. Also when opened it does allow for some dripping from an air hole when inverted. Doesn't spill at all however when cap is closed so it would be perfect for tossing into a bag on the go. bottle mfg in USA but cap in China. From what I have learned while researching cups it doesn't appear that there are any facilities in the us capable of mfg the lids. It is also worth noting that it doesn't have that chemical taste if water is left in it for a day or so like some other ones I have tried.

And I find it amazing, as it was my first time controlling a copter than can do a 360 trick.<br /><br />About the battery, so the lifetime is your average one where the charging time is longer than the playing time, but even so, I really liked this quadcopter so I decided to bought another 3 sets of battery so I can play it longer. Also when it comes to price, it was really cheap than your typical RCs and it was also ready to fly from the box where I find annoying in other brands where it took me few minutes or hours to set up the RC.

The item is great and is easy to set up and take down and is great for my son who is learning t ball now (4 years old).  It is great for soccer also and even golf as the box shows.  There is a 7x7 version and a 5x5 version, both were the same price at the time of purchase so obviously I bought the bigger one and love the item and would recommend it for sure.

It helps avoid dropouts caused by interfering local signals. And to top it off, once the receiver's frequency is chosen it's a snap to sync the transmitter's frequency to it. A terrific product!

Heavy, unwieldy and nearly crippling.  Sat down in O'Hare on Saturday, used my iPad to shop Amazon, found a  rolling duffel exactly the right size i.e. small enough to fit under the sear or in a luggage rack  at exactly my price point--cheap.  And for not much shipping charge, had it delivered Monday to our hotel in Washington DC.  Incredible service and it worked beautifully.  Looks nice too.  Whole experience was WOW!

13238	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B006P0FF3Q	Pokemon (Black - Victini and Reshiram / White - Victini and Zekrom)	This Movie is Way Better than the Diamond/Peal Movies Combined	Forgive me for not liking Generation IV especially the movies but this movie comes off as fresh compared to those movies. The movie is similar to Pokemon Black/White in truth versus ideals (and the anime is going to take the same path with Ash meeting N). There is no villain in this movie. Just a misunderstood anti-villain that wants the best for everyone at the expense of harming Victini.<br /><br />The movie draws some parallel to other movies but overall comes off as a surprisingly improved sequel to the Diamond/Pearl movies. My only gripe is that Cilan and Iris don't play a huge role and are just there in the background. Also, I was saddened that despite Reshiram and Zekrom being on the cover, they are only in the movie for 10/15 minutes.<br /><br />Oh, there was one scene I loved in the Black movie. The scene where Ash pulls off all of these ninja moves in contrast to Ash running away from the falling debris was just hilarious/badass.

18599	__label2__	5	Y	Furniture	B00CFK0AKI	Furniture of America Scout Leatherette Dining Chair, White, Set of 2	Functional, pretty, sturdy chairs.  Highly recommend.	We moved to a small condo and had to downsize on everything, including dining room furniture.  We needed something clean, crisp, and smallish, but still wanted sturdy, functional, and pretty.  Found it all in these wonderful chairs.  They come 2 to a bundle, and we bought white.  They came packaged incredibly well, wrapped in plastic forming a square cube.  It took my husband and me about 20 minutes to unwrap, assemble, and dispose of the packaging -- a pretty successful feat for us!  The chairs are really nice looking, offer strong support, and look wonderful.  We're both on the tall side  (5.7 and 5.11) and not small people, and they fit us well.  We've gone from those big wooden, heavy, padded dining chairs to these light yet fully supportive chairs and are happy about the change.  We paired our chairs with Monarch Specialties Chrome Metal Tempered Glass Dining Table (40&#34;) and they work great together.  The words I'd use for the look are modern, European, minimalist, cool.  In addition, comfy too.

12358	__label2__	5	N	Lawn and Garden	B0002IXKP2	Natural Chemistry 3121 Pool Perfect Concentrate Pool Water Cleaner, 3-Liter	This product really works, Poolman video review	"[[VIDEOID:mo37UNPUFCV43W7]]This product really works as described. It has some kind of powerful enzyme that breaks down scum in the pool water.<br /><br />At this account I would scrub these tiles every week and the scum would just come right back as if I never scrubbed the tile line. The customer would constantly complain.<br /><br />I thought I would give ""Pool Perfect"" by Natural Chemistry a shot here as I have used it successfully on less extreme cases. Basically the problem here is that the dogs will swim in this pool every week and the gardener will blow dust and junk into the pool each week with his leaf blower. It really doesn't help that these tiles are light tan in color.<br /><br />So I scrubbed the tiles once again and then I added the ""Pool Perfect."" To be honest I didn't have high expectations at this account. The next week I was surprised to see the tile looking like I just cleaned them. I added two more capfuls of ""Pool Perfect"" and gave it another week. As you can see from the video after three weeks the tile is still looking like I just cleaned them (As of now it has been 5 weeks and the tile still looks great).  So I have been adding the maintenance dose each week now and  haven't had to scrub the tile line. This stuff works amazingly well.<br /><br />If you are interested in the tile brush (it actually attaches to a pole nicely but in this pool the decking overhangs at an angle so it is easier to use it by hand) Here is the make:<br />Purity Pool TSQC Tile Scrubber with Quick Connect<br /><br />It comes with a regular pad but I upgrade to a more coarse one:<br />Purity Pool RPC Replacement Pad for Tile Scrubber, Coarse"

Nice to be able to charge phone and tablet at the same time as my GF often does while we're in the car.  Since she can now do both with one power outlet this leaves the second power outlet in the car available for me when I need it<br /><br />Hard to get excited about something this mundane but it solves an occasionally annoying issue inexpensively and reliably.

11976	__label2__	5	N	Office Products	B001FBWTHK	Seed Animal Balance Game Eraser Set - Zoo	Fun and challenging balance game eraser set	My sister who lives in Singapore bought this delightful eraser/balance game set for my eight-year-old daughter and both of us love it. My daughter collects erasers and was delighted to receive this set as it contains animals one would find in the wild or at the zoo such as a camel, giraffe, bear, kangaroo, lion, gorilla, elephant, alligator, and more. In all, I think there are about 12 animals.<br /><br />My daughter was even more delighted when she discovered that this is not just an eraser set but a balance game. It is quite challenging since the little animal erasers need to be placed in a certain manner on the balance eraser (the dark eraser on the bottom) so as not to topple over until all the animals have been placed on it. We spent quality time playing this balance game and the little erasers are cute too which makes this a great set for collecting and also for playing with.

14031	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B00874BSGG	Pet Waste Disposal Bags - 1000 Dog Poop Pick Up Bags	Good value! Best bag, best price I could find!	Very convenient.  Keep a roll or one bag in your pocket at all times.  Easy to pull a bag off the roll by sliding thumb nail along the bag to the bottom where there is a little slot where your nail catches in and the bag can be easily removed from the roll.  There is no plastic tube in the center which makes the roll flatten a little in your pocket and is more comfortable.  Who needs a dispenser!  Just more plastic junk that breaks.<br />I've used them for several weeks now without any problems whatsoever:  No seams splitting, no smells, no see through.  The bag is long enough to tie in a knot.  My dog is a French bulldog so the size is adequate..  The bag is probably big enough for up to medium - medium/large dogs.  I recommend this product without any reservations.
